Ravi,5,"Great Image Quality, Light, Small, and  Reasonably Affordable....what more can one ask for?",2015-08-15,N,"First of all I purchased the SX50 directly from Adorama. Sorry Amazon. At the time of purchase, it seemed Amazon changed vendors or suggested vendors hour by hour. One of them was Adorama, and I decided just to purchase directly from them.<br /><br />Regarding the camera. In good light conditions, the camera image quality is excellent. I have used the zoom quite extensively and am amazed at the image quality. Many DSLRs, including our Pentax K-50 have some trouble with the color red. The SX-50 reproduces red as close to perfectly as possible. I compared the SX with the K-50 back to back, same day, same moment, and the SX-50 handling of red was much better than the K-50.<br /><br />The SX-50 has virtually every feature and mode one would expect in a bargain DSLR. Programs, Scenes, Modes (TV, AV, etc.) are all there. The macro function and ability to focus within a cm or less is incredible.<br /><br />The video quality is also quite good. However, the microphones are quite sensitive so I found I had to enter the menus and lower the microphone volume accordingly. I have not used the slow motion feature, but the standard movie mode works great.<br /><br />I like the fold out display feature. The display itself is a bit small, but is fine. The LCD provides plenty of detail, however, in direct sunlight though you see the screen, it is difficult to see enough detail to properly compose a photograph.<br /><br />The viewfinder is fine. Sure it is small (low res), but I believe that many of the complaints I have read about the viewfinder are unjustified, and probably made by users who did not bother to make the diopter adjustment.<br /><br />The camera is light and small, actually a bit too small for my large hands. This format (weight, size, zoom capability) makes it the perfect travel camera.<br /><br />So far so good. The camera is capable of excellent image quality given the light conditions are satisfactory. Now for what I don't like.<br /><br />The battery and flash card compartment cannot be accessed if the camera is mounted to a tripod or tripod mount sling strap is  used. I knew about the compartment location prior to purchased and it did not bother me as I seldom use a tripod and even less frequently would change cards or batteries while on the mount. HOWEVER, I love Joby Sling Straps and they attach using the tripod mount. So now I must remove the strap to change batteries and access the memory card. Bummer.<br /><br />I am constantly inadvertently selecting the timer and other functions. I don't know if it is the compact design or placement, or ???, but dang, every couple of minutes I accidentally select a feature or option. Especially the timer.<br /><br />So, in summary. I would definitely purchase the camera again, though I noticed the price increased by $60. It is a great advanced point and shoot camera. I am amazed by the image quality and zoom image quality. Wish they would have placed the battery and memory compartment in a different location but that is a minor inconvenience given the performance of the camera. It is light, small, capable, and reasonably affordable...what more can you ask for?d compartment cannot be accessed if the camera is mounted to a tripod or tripod mount sling strap is  used.

Shubham k.,4,Another Very Good product from Canon,2015-08-01,Y,"I read a lot of the reviews on this site before buying this. I bought it because my SLR developed a focusing problems and with a 50X optical zoom I could carry less weight and have most of the same flexibility  and convenience that an SLR offers. Most of that has turned out to be true. I have a limited amount of experience with the new camera so far, but to date it has exceeded my expectations. Focus can take some time when shooting into variable depth situations. I read a lot about poor low light problems, but took pictures at the zoo yesterday in a nocturnal environment (practically NO light) and with a little bit of adjustment in Picasa, have picture that are not great, but acceptable. This is using available light only. Very pleased with that. It allows me to get pictures that others may find impossible. More later if I find more positive/negative comments, but so far a VERY good experience.",3,2,Canon SX50,0
Amazon Customer,5,battery life is a good example. So far I have taken 485 pics ...,2015-07-31,Y,"Bought this even though the SX-60 is available - some reviews worried me too much - and I certainly do not regret it.  Some technical details missed the mark badly, battery life is a good example.  So far I have taken 485 pics & videos (nearly all using the viewfinder) and still have over half of the battery left.  Technical details estimated a life of 315, but maybe they were using the display.  Some reviews mentioned issues with auto-focus while taking macro shots.  It definitely took some getting used to & became much easier when I noticed the focus range displayed in the viewfinder while zooming.  The two drawbacks I noted were the lack of threads to attach a filter - I really like protecting that lens - and the lack of a printed manual.  There are WAY too many options & features to learn 'on your own.'",0,0,Canon SX50,0
Let's make it,5,Love this camera,2015-07-30,Y,"There are many, many reviews of this camera so I will keep my comments short and to the point. After a week of studying my options for a superzoom camera, the choices I had to consider were the SX50, SX60, Sony HX400V and Nikon P600 (with some Fuji models also possible).  The SX 60 has a few enticing enhancements (WiFi and more zoom) but in comparisons the SX50 appeared to have better resolution at high zoom negating one of those advantages. The Sony was a contender but was the heaviest in comparison and not quite as good in resolution or ease of use from reviews in various places inc. DPR. Nikon looked really good until I read some of the consistent negative comments. I am very happy with my choice.  Positives are the fantastically good image stabilization.  Hand held picture of the moon at maximum focus was Unbelievable and looked like it had been taken through a telescope with ridges on craters at the edge of a full moon clearly visible...........REALLY.  Bird pictures at full zoom similarly great.  The biggest surprise I had was how intuitive and user friendly this camera is.  Although it has LOTS o features and capabilities, finding the alternatives seems to be a lot easier than on my other Canon ELPH cameras.  With my positive rating and great experiences I need to say that I bought the SX50HS as a Reconditioned model at a great price and have given the seller an equally high 5 stars for a camera that is in 100% new condition with Amazon Prime delivery.",6,6,Canon SX50,2

Frustrating that they've moved some of the buttons in different places from the previous versions. Just takes some getting used to . BUT, I was very unhappy with the condition it came in. Maybe it had been a Demo or something. If so, it should have SAID so.  The lens had something smeared all over it and was very hard to remove. Was very worried about damaging the lens. It was very dusty. The only reason I decided to keep it was because I was in the middle of taking photos of a rare duck and I NEEDED a camera because my other one was in the process of dying on me.

Digic 5 is a beast.<br />  I am attaching a few pictures so you can see how well this camera works.<br />&#62;  Great pics: This camera excels at optical zoom, but even besides that, this camera can take excellent pictures at wide angles.<br />&#62;  Portability:  If you are considering buying a DSLR camera vs a bridge camera like this, I would definitely give this one a shot.<br />  This is compact in the sense, that you don't have to change lenses.<br />  You can just take it and go anywhere without carrying anything extra, like you would with most DSLR cameras.<br />  This is bigger and heavier than the regular point and shoot camera without so much optical zoom.<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#62; It struggles the right exposure when shooting around sunset. You gotta fiddle with the manual settings a lot.<br />&#62;  Steep learning curve to learn the manual setting modes.<br />&#62;  Not everything (exposure, aperture, shutter speed, ISO) has a dedicated button, even though they are displayed very clearly on the LCD viewfinder.<br />&#62;  A lot of wind noise while you are taking video.

The depth of field has been disappointing and fine tuning it is not intuitive or easily accomplished. The camera also does not handle bright light well and adjustments are required to compensate.

Bhunesh Nayak,5,"The unofficial camera of Alaska, and worth every penney",2015-06-18,Y,"If you're looking for a technical review, move along.  I am a &#34;tourist&#34; photographer, that just wants to be able to capture decent memories, specifically on my trip to Alaska.  After reading many, many Alaska trip reports from other people and seeing a lot of photos taken with this camera, I decided I needed it for our trip.  I am *so* glad I spent the money on this.  I'm one of those people who leave it in &#34;Auto&#34; mode and hope for the best, and I have some wonderful pics and videos (that I'm still sorting through).  But the real selling point of this camera is the optical zoom, which is so important for wildlife viewing in Alaska.  50x, without changing lenses is just amazing.  There were 3 separate occasions where a stranger next to me told me, &#34;There's no use in trying to take a picture of that, sweetheart - it's too far away&#34;.  I just smiled, took the photo, and showed them the result - they were shocked.  I had 2 other people looking over my shoulder in Denali and tap me on the shoulder to ask what kind of camera I had.  There were times when I used this camera instead of binoculars.<br /><br />I have 3 tips for extreme novices (like me):<br />- If you find you're primarily using the display panel and not the view finder, you can rotate the panel and fold it back against itself so that you don't have to flip it open every time you want to take a picture.  (Imagine how dumb I felt when a fellow cruiser pointed this out...)  Also, while it's on the digital display you won't be able to use the view finder, but if you press the &#34;Disp&#34; button, you can cycle through and activate it again.<br />- It is difficult to steady the camera when you're zoomed in all the way.  To help, pull on the lens cap string to provide tension and steady the camera (another tip from that same cruiser, which I used every single day afterward)<br />- Disclaimer: this is probably entirely obvious to everyone besides me, but just in case there's anyone else struggling with the flash... there is no button to make the flash pop up.  You literally use your finger and manually flick it up.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're a point-and-shoot tourist photographer heading to Alaska, you will not regret buying this camera. All others can read the more detailed reviews. :-)there is no button to make the flash pop up.  You literally use your finger and manually flick it up.

Dr.Rakhi singh,3,IMHO Newer isn't Always Better,2015-06-01,Y,"I've been a Canon PowerShot owner for 10 years, beginning with the SX10. I have been impressed with the improvements in the models over the years (for the most part) except now. I had a SX40 for 3 years but it was in need of a tune up which would cost as much as a new camera, so I opted for a new one. Decided to give the SX50 a try even after reading the cons thinking they were issues I could adapt to...or maybe just individual issues. Well, bottom line is I returned it and purchased another SX40. The SX50 had trouble with a consistent and true focus when zooming and as others noted, it took many tries to get it to focus on a further subject if there was a closer object in the field of view.<br /><br />I also didn't like the placement of the on/off button closer to the viewfinder. On the SX40 the on off button is  within easy finger distance when holding the camera with one hand and is easy to maneuver; not so with the SX50. Unless you've got a long pointer finger you've got to hold the camera with both hands and give it a good push (at least the one I had took several pushes).  This is important to me as I could manipulate most all the controls with one hand and several fingers on the SX40. I guess it's just what you get use to.<br /><br />Bottom line, I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the inconsistent and not sharp zoom focus as compared to the SX40 so I returned it and will purchase a new sx40.",10,9,Canon SX50,3

VINOD YADAV,2,Disappointed,2015-05-28,N,"I purchased this camera to replace one I loved from a company no longer in this market. This one has good reviews and friends recommended it. I got an exceptional price because of the new model that had just been released. So far, so good. However after months of using the camera I find changing modes much more difficult and often miss shots because of it. The camera keeps getting lighter, weightwise, but now I feel they are trading quality to get the lighter weight.<br /><br />It's advantage is the zoom, which is why I purchased it, but I find myself wanting to pull out my old camera with less zoom instead of using this one. I don't usually have the old one with, and cuss this camera often.<br /><br />I would not repurchase and will, next time around, hopefully find another I like better.",4,2,Canon SX50,3

I've had it a week and I'm already sure I made the right choice.  I'm not an expert, or even intermediate, photographer by any means, and I surely haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what this camera can do, but the long zoom and image stabilization alone have enabled me to take pictures that FAR exceed anything I've ever gotten in past with typical point and shoots. This is exactly what I needed to get shooting quality bird pictures without a ton of study or time screwing around with manual settings while the spring migrants are feeding everywhere in my local park. I find a bird, frame the shot, let the auto-focus settle, and fire away. If/when the bird sits still long enough for that brief cycle, the results have been very impressive. Highly recommended if you need zoom power and want to get going with nature photography very quickly. See attached for one of my better bird pictures taken in my first week with the unit. Thanks to others for the reviews which helped me settle on this camera, very much appreciated.",8,8,Canon SX50,1
Manpreet,5,Hmmmm..,2015-05-09,Y,"Where to start.... The truth is I really do NOT like this camera. My daughter fell in love with my Lumix DMC-FC70 and I was wanting to try this camera out... So... I gave her my lumix.. Now there's a camera I can honestly say I love.  I'm a pretty big guy with big hands and this Canon feels and looks like a childs toy in my hand, I keep hitting all the buttons with the palm of my hand.  The camera is small and weighs about a much as a puff of wind. ( I know some folks like a light weight camera )  I constantly turn on the self timer every (almost every) time I press the shutter. If I look through the viewfinder my hand somehow accidentally turns on the menu .. For me the buttons are in the wrong places.  Wow.. Why did I give it 5 stars??  Well...  It really is a nice camera. I really like that the flash does not pop up all the time.. you have to lift it to use it.. Photos are sharp and clear, it has a nice quiet zoom excellent anti vibration system and it does everything it is supposed to do. You can use an external shutter release.. (wired) why don't all of these long zoom cameras have a shutter release  The faults I mention are not the cameras fault... It's mine for having large hands.. So.. that's something you might want to take into consideration if you are a large person. In case you are wondering I had this camera 3 days and ordered another Lumix.. Now I gotta figure out who to give this Canon to. I hope this review helps someone make a good decision.",6,6,Canon SX50,2

What a thrill to be able to zoom in and focus on a bird's eye!  The camera is light, compact, and simple to use.  All I want to do is to just take pictures quickly when I see something I want to capture, without a lot of fussing with lenses and settings, etc.  Perfect camera for me.",10,10,Canon SX50,4

I was looking for a camera that could take good pictures of objects moving fairly quickly at a distance. I think this is a great camera. If you are looking for really professional photos, it may not be for you, but the pictures are still really great for a point-and-shoot. I take pictures of my husband riding his CR125 at the motocross track, and most of the pictures are clear and defined even though he is moving fast. The zoom is amazing. The camera is not too heavy to hold up for long periods of time, at least not for me. I would recommend this camera to anyone because I am very happy with it.

It can be point and shoot or you can play with much more advanced settings.  More importantly, although bigger than a &#34;pocket&#34; camera, this camera has one (very flexible) lens that makes it much lighter and more compact than many costlier camera systems.

Keerthi,4,Meets Expectations,2015-03-16,Y,"This camera's biggest selling point is its 24 - 1200mm optical zoom. From its widest to its closest distance, the quality is surprisingly solid. In daylight, the autofocus performs well. The poorest aspect of the camera is its internal viewfinder. It's difficult to view any image distortion-free, which makes the manual focus option problematic. The flip-out viewfinder, which also rotates nicely, provides an acceptable but not dazzling image.<br /><br />The camera's menu is a little congested, and it's easy to launch a menu item while rotating the menu/iris wheel while prepping for a shot.<br /><br />The reason for owning this camera is its 1200mm lens, and on that account it meets expectations. It's a good adjunct camera for a DSLR shooter.",3,3,Canon SX50,1

I just can't live with it. I will sell ASAP. I have large hands and the main setting/controls gets easily pushed unless I keep my palm and thumb away, off the camera. There is no sweet spot to comfortably hold the camera especially the record and timer buttons. I'm constantly pushing by mistake. You have to be very nimble. I can only girp the camera with three fingers and you thumb naturally wants to grip the back side right where the controls are.

One thing for sure about this digital camera, it will take pretty good photos.<br />Good areas so far I have found with this camera includes: photo quality outdoors is very good during the daytime hours and questionable at night or very low light conditions without using flash. Sunset and sunrise photos using the Program mode and altering settings slightly produces outstanding photos in those lower light conditions for me. Camera is fairly easy to use, decent menu system and easy to navigate, has a &#34;sport mode&#34; for a quick 10 photos shot very fast, hot shoe attachment for external flash, great 50X optical zoom, flip out LCD viewfinder and optical viewfinder also, takes excellent indoor photos with flash and video quality is good. SD cards are accepted and that's good for this camera. Battery life seems very good for this camera, even using flash. I would get several spare batteries for this camera and maybe an extra charger. This camera comes with a Canon battery and charger also. I got 3 extra batteries [not Canon batteries] and they last just as long as the Canon batteries do. I also got 1 extra battery charger for this camera. The camera has manual settings also plus Auto setting.<br />Bad areas so far I have noticed is: this camera has difficulty taking photos through windows or glass unless you move the camera around a bit and that's a focus issue there, low light photos with no flash are questionable in quality. Use the flash and the photos will be a bit better.<br />It generally has taken pretty good photos for me so far in daytime hours and some terrific sunset/sunrise photos and with the 50X optical zoom, I have got some decent moon shots of full or near full moons with this camera too.<br />It won't rival any DSLR for excellent photo.....but does a pretty good job taking photos!

Nothing worthwhile to keep in you camera bag for a camera with too many settings to remember. WORSE, lacks details for several functions, or, at least, several functions not sufficiently indexed to find operational details. For example, the &#34;M&#34; mode is neither indexed nor discussed in the &#34;Mode&#34; section. In that mode, the default seems to be shutter speed adjustment, but no indication as to adjusting the aperture. The &#34;priority&#34; modes give exposure selection to the camera via the &#34;other&#34; adjustment.

I did, but today I got an email saying it's NOT under warranty, and it will cost me $89 to get a refurbished camera because they don't do repairs on this model! Why would they tell me to send a camera in for repairs if they don't perform repairs on that model? And why would I want the same model camera (that has the same problems) if it can't be repaired? So now Canon has my original $429 and my piece of crap camera. I'm tempted to tell them where they can put that camera- I'll go spend my $ on a reliable camera that can actually take pictures in low-light conditions (which the sx50 can NOT do)",2,1,Canon SX50,4

Amazon Customer,5,A Best Buy for the non-SLR guy!,2015-01-06,Y,"I been using Canon cameras for many years (yup, even before digital! old)... with-out going to an SLR, this is about as good as it gets.  My 3rd high zoom camera, and this is my favorite.<br />My &#34;great to amazing&#34; list:  zoom, zoom, zoom, color, picture quality, manual mode features, image stabilization, swivel LCD for those hard to get pics and stereo HD-video!!!  Got a few terrabytes of great pictures to show.  Also, the video with the stabilized big zoom cant be beat.  I film my kids from the start of a ski run to the bottom in full HD, and I don't need to leave the base of the mountain!  (if I don't want to ;-)<br />And now my &#34;Good&#34; list:  low light pictures, fast action pictures and ease to make changes in manual mode.  To get better low light pictures, you need a bigger lens opening... thus go to SLR, oh well.  Fast action or sport pictures are good, if you have enough light.  Dark/very cloudy days, inside arenas, etc... not so good, usually a little blurred.  If you also use the zoom, the blurry gets amplified proportionately.  The manual mode takes a lot of times to figure out.  The functions are there, but some are not so easy to get to and change... before your picture opportunity is gone!  I would prefer they got rid of the MANY preset picture settings (many are just gimmicks) and just gave me easier manual operation.<br />I added filters and lens hoods to my camera - great, but the flash gets screwed-up (you will get shadows!).  So an external flash is needed if you use those items... and that's why it has a hot shoe!",5,4,Canon SX50,1

purushottama yadav,5,Super nice little camera,2015-01-05,Y,"I bought this camera for my wife so she'd have something lighter than her Canon 60D when we went on vacation.  As it turns out she uses it most of the time (except when doing very specialized stuff) because it's so convenient and the zoom is so incredible.  We call it the &#34;spycam&#34; since it zooms in on just about anything.  It takes great pictures (OK, likely my wife has something to do with the great pictures too...)<br /><br />This camera is especially nice for someone who still wants a &#34;real&#34; camera, but doesn't want the heaviness of an SLR with lenses to pack around.  Great for vacations, hiking, going to the beach, etc.<br /><br />Another good point is the price is so good compared to the professional cameras that if you take it on vacation you don't have to worry about it as much as you would with your better equipment",5,4,Canon SX50,3

Great for that Hawaii trip where you want to catch a whale breaching, but for clear shots at full zoom bring a tripod. Indoors with a flash is good, but don't expect F1.8 performance from this F3.4 lense. It just needs more light.",3,2,Canon SX50,1
Miranda Ghosh,5,Really Great Camera,2015-01-01,Y,"My wife is quite the photography enthusiast and owns a couple of DSLR cameras.  I wasn't willing to invest that kind of money into a high end camera when I've never even taken a photography class.  But I do have an interest in photography, and thought it would be fun to have a camera that could produce something better than my iPhone!<br /><br />The Canon PowerShot SX50 turned out to be the perfect beginners camera.  First off you can just set it on auto and use it like any old point and shoot.  It has a massive zoom which allows for some pretty incredible pictures.  You can zoom optically by 50x and then 4x more digitally for a 200x zoom.  Obviously if you zoom to the max you will compromise the picture quality somewhat, but it is still surprisingly good.<br /><br />Once you have decided to take off the training wheels you can experiment with some of the cameras more advanced features.  You can set the camera to shutter priority which allows you to take the great action shot or freeze water droplets flying through the air.  You can use aperture priority and get those nice depth of field images where an object is in focus and the background is not.  There is even a full manual mode if you want to get very technical.  There are also guided auto settings for action shots, night time and various other scenarios.<br /><br />I have attached some pictures taken with the camera.  All freehand, no tripod.  Even the zoom in on the moon was just taken standing in the back yard one night.<br /><br />I've read articles to suggest that even serious photographers like this camera because unlike their fancy DSLR, this camera is very lightweight.  And to get a zoom as good as this one on a DSLR would set you back thousands of dollars, and would weigh a ton.<br /><br />If you want to take more serious pictures than your iPhone can, then this is a great camera to play around with.  I've taken mine on various trips and have managed to take some good pictures with it.<br /><br />Of the attached images you'll see three animals taken at a zoo, which illustrate the powerful zoom (clearly I am not all that close to these dangerous animals!).  A moon shot, showing not even the max zoom.  It was taken during a 'honey moon' that's why it's not the usual color.  And there's a fountain image, you can see how the water is frozen mid stream with high shutter speed.<br /><br />I think that this camera is well suited to both beginners and more seasoned photographers.  Definitely worth a closer look this one.attached images you'll see three animals taken at a zoo, which illustrate the powerful zoom (clearly I am not all that close to these dangerous animals!).

Amazon Customer,5,Upgrade SX40 to SX50 or SX60? I chose SX50.,2014-12-21,Y,"I recently moved near a lake with lots of birds. My SX40 was great, but I wanted more telephoto. I got excited when the SX60 came out, but after combing through the specs and early reviews, I decided on the SX50 because:<br /><br />1) Price - $150 less than the SX60 (Dec. 2014).<br /><br />2) Telephoto only a minor upgrade from SX50 to SX60, but a big upgrade from the SX40 (840mm > 1200mm > 1365mm).<br /><br />3) I didn't think upgrade to 16MP (from 12MP) was worth much. The last time I went from 12 to 16MP (Lumix G2 to G5), I hardly noticed any difference.<br /><br />4) The SX60's higher-res LCDs would have been nice if these cameras had focusing rings on the lens, but I gave up trying to use the thumb dial for manual focusing. Given that, even the SX40's LCDs were good enough for me.<br /><br />5) Excellent reviews for the SX50 (4.5 stars, 928 reviews), the jury is still out on the SX60 (3.8 stars, 29 reviews). Early SX50 reviews were better than the SX60's, but that might be because expectations are too high for the SX60.<br /><br />MY TWO CENTS: At this point in the SX50's lifecycle I can't add much, but I generally agree with the reviews that preceded mine - it's a noticeably more polished SX40 with a big jump in telephoto. I did a quick side-by-side full-zoom comparison with my SX40 and I was pleased with the results. I don't plan to use RAW much and I didn't see much difference in SuperFine over Fine JPG (other than the file size going from 4.3MB to 6.5MB). I'm still evaluating shutter lag and focus speed, but it's behaving as expected so far. I also prefer the smaller physical size. One minor surprise was the digital zoom. I've always avoided it thinking I could do it myself in Photoshop, but I tried a shot at 100x (2400mm) and it actually looked a little better. The SX50 even goes to 200x (4800mm) if I feel lucky. Maybe I should have tried the SX40's digital zoom.<br /><br />One other note - I'm happy that Canon didn't change the battery between all three models. That way I don't have to bring more chargers and spare batteries if I travel with both. (I'm still mad at Panasonic for changing batteries from the G2 to G5).<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Upgrading from the SX40 to the SX50 was worth the price I paid ($349) because more telephoto was most important to me. I'm not saying it's perfect (there are things I would change), but it's an excellent bridge camera - worth 5 stars. If you're not upgrading, the SX40 and I assume SX60 are excellent too - just pick your price-point and get one (and yes, I considered Panasonic, Nikon, & Sony before choosing Canon). Who knows, maybe I'll get an SX60 too someday, but that will depend on what the SX70 brings to the table (...and price, of course).",11,11,Canon SX50,3

Amazon Customer,4,AMAZING ZOOM!,2014-12-02,N,"After going on many vacation trips without nice pictures to remember, I decided to step up and get a nice camera. My only experience with a digital camera is an old Canon SD450. I was thinking of getting a DSLR, but really didn't like the idea of lugging around heavy equipment and spending extra $$$ for lenses. After countless hours of reading reviews and watching youtube videos, I decided to buy the SX50. I've had it now for about a 8 months and it's been a great investment. I've been able to take shots that I can never do before. The zoom is amazing! Moon shots, birds, animals or landscape shots are now all possible. Even macro shots were easy to produce. I love the fireworks setting and received a lot of compliments even without a tripod. It also produces great videos and sound and all made easier with articulating LCD. There are so many preset modes, I'm still trying to figure them all out.<br /><br />There are a couple of negatives with this camera though. First off, the view finder is less than desirable. I still use it, but definitely not the camera's strong suit. Another thing that I found not too long ago is that if you are in video mode and decides to take a still picture, the video will stop momentarily. That is something I didn't expect, but it's there. Somewhat annoying. The OEM battery is ok, but I bought after market ones on ebay and they last longer. Low light pictures are ok, but what do you expect at this price. I'm now thinking getting an external flash to help this out.<br /><br />I'm writing this review during cyber Monday as I am contemplating upgrading to the Canon T5i. There's some great deals on them as the price has dropped. However, after looking at the initial cost and money that I will spend on lenses, it reminded me why I decided against a DSLR at the first place. If my friends (who are professional photographers) with all their fancy cameras and lenses are impressed with some of my pictures, then that's good enough for me.",5,5,Canon SX50,3

Akshatha,5,Loving it so far.,2014-11-02,Y,"Coming from an Olympus point and shoot, the SX50 was a definite step up.  At a convention last year, my little Olympus just couldn't give me the pics I wanted from where I was sitting.  I realized I couldn't really be mad at it since I was asking it to do shots it simply wasn't able to give me.  This year I went again, sat in the same row, and the SX50 got me my shots.  Even in the low light conditions that usually happens at these conventions I still was happy with the majority of my pics.  Are there limitations in low light situations, sure there were but I just kept shooting, changed the settings a few times, and still got more I liked than I didn't.<br /><br />I'm just an average Joe photographer with no special training.  I just wanted something that would give me some nice pictures, not kill my wallet and the SX50 does that quite nicely.<br /><br />BTW, my first time out with the camera I took the Sunflower pic and just the other day I got the Moon pic.

Amazon Customer,4,Great Camera To Learn With On Your Way To a More Pro Camera or For a Work Horse Photo Camera,2014-10-30,N,"I've had this camera for a little bit now. I believe almost a year and I've been using this as my main work horse camera before graduating to the more professional line a Canon 5 and 7D cameras. I was able to catch this camera at Best Buy during a crazy sale and was able to knock off something like $150 off the camera which was a strong reason I bought it as I was pushed for time to use it on a project I do. What I like about this camera and really surprised me the most was it's ability to get great clean looking photos in low light conditions with very little setup to the camera. If you know what your doing with an Aperture and Shutter, you're going to do fine. I leave this camera in Manual mode mostly and it's really quick to set everything for the photo. I work as a videographer and photographer creating videos of Haunted House attractions for a website I run called Haunters Digest and our YouTube channel. So having a camera that can handle a run and gun type photography while working in seriously low light settings is something I thought I could only really pull off with a more high end camera. But this camera has really pulled it's weight and made me appreciate the Cannon brand even more because of it. I've attached some sample raw unedited photos taken with camera to show you what I mean. In bright light conditions it's incredible. But even in low level conditions, it's still really impressive. I usually travel with a little LED canteen light or LED camera light just to add a little extra light, but it's still doing a great job. At the end of the day, if your looking for a great affordable camera to really experiment with before going to the more high-end cameras, this I would recommend. If I had a child interested in photography in high school, I would start them with this to master photography basics, then move them in the real of lens and more complex cameras and their settings.",4,4,Canon SX50,3

Amazon Customer,4,"Great camera, but maybe a bit fragile?",2014-10-17,Y,"The first SX50 I received started getting the dreaded &#34;Lens Error&#34; message on the third day or forth day I owned it-- ironic, since my six (?) year old Canon S5 IS died of the same message a few weeks ago (though that camera had a pretty good excuse-- it fell off of the roof of the car as I pulled onto the highway; oddly enough it worked fine for a week or so after the fall before it succumbed).<br /><br />Anyway, Amazon sent me a new camera promptly and it's been fine so far.  I'm a bit worried that the outrageous zoom range will prove to have resulted in a more fragile camera.  But the photos are wonderful.  It's a mighty complicated beast, though, and I'm just starting to get to know it.",0,0,Canon SX50,3
Amazon Customer,5,Grab it while you can.  Read this before you do!,2014-10-17,N,"I belong to a photography forum and this camera was the most talked about bridge camera to date.  Many pictures from different members were often uploaded and showed some magnificent results including a HAND-HELD image of the moon and it's detailed craters. I couldn't believe it. The image was far superior to my 150-500mm Sigma on my new Nikon D5300, which was mounted on a tripod and triggered remotely.  The 1200mm zoom capability alone is worth the money.<br />BTW, now that the SX60 is out, you can pick these up (MAYBE!) for far less than they were 2 or 3 weeks ago (Today is 10-17-2014.)<br />I purchased mine at Target for 214 minus 15% as it was a floor sample, but another member said they got the last one at Sam's Club for $167 complete.

Customer from bengaluru,5,This is the best beginner DSLR and some tips on shooting.,2015-08-12,N,To me the Canon EOS Rebel line of DSLR cameras are the best for those wanting to get into more advanced photography. The main reasons are they allow you full manual controls and the interchangeable lenses. These allow you to change so much of how the cameras functions in different lighting situations. And over the last five years Canon digital SLR cameras have become very capable of 1080p high definition video cameras also. Over the course of this review I get a mention some basics about digital photography that can help you if you're a first-time camera buyer.<br /><br />NOTE: You can get the older models like the T3i and save a few bucks but still get the full manual controls like this camera. Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens The thing about the T3i is that it's all around a better camera and even more advanced than this one.

It's my first, but what I want to do is approach this review from the pov of a first-time DLSR user. I kinda have no choice, eh? But what I mean is, instead of going on about specifics, I am looking at how easy was it for a beginner like me to use this camera.<br /><br />The short and simple answer: Very easy.<br /><br />First, let me say I have had several Canon compact point-and-shoot digital cameras. My current one is the Powershot SX280 HS, which I LOVE. One thing I love about Canon is that they tend to set up their cameras very similarly between models, so I had no trouble getting used to where buttons were and what different symbols mean and how to scroll through menus.<br /><br />Some of the features I really like about the T5 are the weight, the fit in my hand, the large view screen, the button placement, the battery life, the ease of use of the software for uploading pictures, and the picture quality is great....

Rahul Singh,5,Pleasantly surprised!,2015-08-08,N,"So far, I am very pleased with the T5. I will admit that I was skeptical, as I have been using a Nikon D40 for the last 4 years (which has been great, but starting to have some lens issues!) and never liked using my sister's Canon XSi. It took me several days to get used to the button layout, but overall, the camera felt comfortable and almost familiar in my hands.<br /><br />No, this review won't argue Canon vs. Nikon - I'm not enough beyond amateur to do that.<br /><br />The T5 took sharp, bright, color-accurate outdoor photos; indoor were slightly less so, but I felt that was lack of photographer skills. I'm still learning manual settings, and I don't always get them right. I fall back on AV mode (aperture priority) too often, but even the auto settings captured photos that I was very pleased with.<br /><br />I did find that in low lighting, the auto focus searched longer than I felt it shouldor liked.

However, I bought it to shoot video, and planned to use an external mic since the internal mic on any DSLR is not sufficient. I was horrified when I discovered there is NO POSSIBLE WAY TO USE AN EXTERNAL MIC. That thing that looks like a mic jack is actually for a remote control. I would think that is a key feature that I should have known before purchasing but I guess not. So for anyone who wants to shoot video, go with the Nikon D3200, D3300, or D5200.

The optical viewfinder is blocked when the LCD panel is used because the mirror is lifted. This kit, from Canon, comes with both a18-55 mm and a 75-300 mm auto focus Canon lens plus a case.

The camera can be used like a point and shoot camera or used in a totally manual/professional  mode with all settings controlled by the user.

We upgraded from the cheaper point-and-shoot pocket cameras ...,2015-06-11,Y,"This camera is just plain awesome!<br /><br />We upgraded from the cheaper point-and-shoot pocket cameras and I was wondering which DSLR camera to get. I mainly compared Nikon to Cannon and asked several Best Buy employees pros and cons. Basically it comes down to this:<br /><br />Cannon has slightly better electronics to the camera and the interface/menus seem to be a little more intuitive.<br />Nikon has slightly better lenses.<br /><br />So we purchased the Rebel T5 and the battery life is excellent and has been a great entry level DSLR camera. the only downside that I have ever noticed is that this has 3 pictures continuous speed. But that was only a slight disappointment coming from an iPhone 5s that has about 10 frames per second for rapid speed pictures. But I'm completely satisfied with this camera and it takes great pictures for how we use it. As always the camera doesn't just MAKE good pictures, you have to obviously use it correctly and on the proper settings (meaning you can still get some blurry pictures if you don't pay attention)... For just coming into the DSLR camera scene myself I found the Cannon Rebel T5 to be just a great product and I will be more inclined to get another Cannon next time.",6,5,Canon T5 Bundle v2,4

I have been very pleased with the ease of use of this camera and my photos have definitely improved.  I'm not sure I will ever use all the features, but there are plenty of options (I'm still happy with the auto-focus mode).

Meenakshi,4,Great first DSLR,2015-05-29,Y,"Great starter DSLR.  This is my first camera that is not a point-and-shoot and it's great, especially for the price.  The lens that comes with it is also pretty darn good.  The automatic settings do a really good job of picking shutter speeds, f stops, and white balances for great photos.  I also really like the aperture priority and shutter speed priority settings.  The shutter speed priority setting is especially useful for taking photos when motion is an issue, such as from a moving vehicle.  lso, there is a great feature in some modes that allows you to set 3 exposure levels and take 3 photos at different exposures.  Doing this is not very intuitive though and takes some manual reading.<br /><br />I do wish that this camera could take photos in aspect ratios other than 3:2, but that's all it can do.  There is no panorama setting either.<br /><br />Overall, a very good camera as a first DSLR.  A huge upgrade from point and shoot.",29,25,Canon T5 Bundle v2,2

praveen,5,Great camera for the price!,2015-05-20,Y,"This is a great little camera, and would be a fantastic choice for someone who is new to DSLR. I learned how to use 35mm SLR first, so it was an easy transition to digital.<br /><br />Exposure (f-stop/aperture) ISO, focus, shutter speed, and white balance are all able to be controlled manually on manual mode. At 18 megapixels, it shoots very pretty stills, and even with the included lens I can achieve a soft background.<br /><br />I bought this camera specifically to shoot video, and it does make a sharp and pretty image. That having been said, there are some drawbacks as this is primarily a still camera. It can only write files as large as 4gb before automatically stopping recording. I haven't found any way to make it continue without manually restarting. This is only a minor irritation and easily enough corrected. I use it as the main camera for the close-up when I video my dad's church services (www.godtel.org, any of the recent videos will have HD footage shot by this camera). Since I know when I'm going to be cutting to another angle, I just reset this one while it won't be up and problem solved.<br /><br />I soon hope to get better lenses to go with it, but as far as I can tell, this is the best bang for your buck for a starter DSLR with full manual controls.",8,7,Canon T5 Bundle v2,1

I had this item in my carts &#34;save for later' for about a year now and the minute I saw the price drop on the kit with the 75-300mm lens, I bought it.<br /><br />Canon's ability to pack features in a camera that won't break the bank is awesome. I was able to use it right out of the box and the manual that comes on the CD is very comprehensive. If you are a total beginner at photography you will be able to understand and follow the directions to get you out of &#34;auto&#34; mode and into their creative zone modes. If you want to shoot in auto, there are a lot of great settings that will let you do so.<br /><br />I have had this camera since May 5 and have already shot over 1000 photos with it!

With that being said, for being such an affordable camera, the T5 does everything I need it to do. The only thing I MIGHT suggest is investing in a 300mm lens, depending on what you're photographing.<br /><br />Canon makes a great camera and I truly believe that anyone that is getting into photography or wants more than a simple digital camera will be more than satisfied with the T5. The T5i has a few extra bells an whistles, but I'm not completely convinced that those are worth the extra money.<br /><br />Like I said earlier, this camera is great and anyone could easily get a ton of use with it by having a decent range of lenses.",1,1,Canon T5 Bundle v2,3

Ajmal M.,4,User friendly and a great camera for starters!,2015-04-06,N,"After years of point and shoot photos experience I decided it was time to graduate to a photographic solution that would accurately capture the feel and quality of a moment. After doing quite a bit of research, quizzing friends who have shared a broad range of well taken images with me over the year, I came up with two camera’s: this Canon EOS Rebel T5 and the camera listed here: http://amzn.to/2ouY4V7  Both cameras seemed to be really good in terms of specifications, but I finally decided to go for this Canon as I’m familiar with those cameras. Now I can say this Canon EOS Rebel easily won the &#34;best of&#34; camera decision. While it takes a certain eye for the shot desired, the images we've seen and have shared all have a few commonalities; consistent low noise images with crisp lines, solid/repeatable saturation and a focusing phenome. Combined with required shutter speed for outdoor, glare intensive action shots: it’s a Big Winner!!  I've been experimenting and carrying the Rebel around with me for the past 3 weeks, it’s lightweight and packed with enough power and finesse to capture precision shots of athletes in action or the grimace of a weight lifter as he pushes through to a personal best. It takes really nice photos indoors, outside, and the resolution is really great. The video functions are much better than the digital camera I had before as it has multiple settings with different dimensions and fps presets.  I'll experiment next on shots to include more practice with lighting, stills of completed work and portraits. Initial shots I've taken - confirmed my suspicions, I should continue to expect beautiful results! SO overall I can say this camera is spot on and a fantastic investment for those photographers/videographers who are looking for a camera that won't cost thousands of dollars!ds of dollars!",25,21,Canon T5 Bundle v2,2

I've always loved taking photographs--especially of my family--and now I have this perfect camera with which to do so. The 18-55mm lense has decent zoom, though it's obviously best for closer shots. It provides high quality photos that lend themselves well to Photoshop.  The downsides are that the lens is loud, and even shooting in RAW there is too much noise in the photos. Cropping is almost out of the question, especially if you used the kit lens. Just to see if it was the camera or the lens causing problems for me, I purchased a $700 18-200mm IS lens and tested it out. The pictures were barely any better than the ones I took with the kit lens. I was shocked. At this point, I realized that I needed to upgrade the camera and be done with it.  It's definitely a beginner's camera. I was happy with it for about a month.",45,34,Canon T5 Bundle v2,1

It was a terrific buy from Amazon and I couldn't be more thrilled.  I can hardly wait to take some close ups (my backyard is a Nature Center and forever wild area) and there are beautiful birds that come to my feeders and wildlife of all kind.

I love the quality of images both indoor, outdoor, action, portrait, macro, you name it. We have a very active toddler and we are able to capture every special moment and expression. I'm generally not happy with indoor pictures that require a flash but the quality of the flash and lower light settings on this camera are much better than any camera I've had in the past. It was a close toss but between this camera and one by Sony, glad we with this with one.

Gilson Paul K P,5,First time DSLR user,2015-01-02,N,"My last camera was a Panasonic Lumix LX5. I loved that camera size and was always weary about getting a full size DSLR camera. I do make annual yearbooks for my kids so I want the pictures to be nice quality, but I also don't want to lug a big camera around. Also a factor against buying this is my inevitable upgrade to the iPhone 6 (and then 7 / 8 ) that has a very nice camera. That said, I have been playing with this camera the last couple of days and I am getting the quality shots that I have always wanted. Especially when using manual controls indoors with no flash. The automatic pictures are easy and come out nice but I am highly motivated to use the manual controls. The picture quality when you dial it in on manual is better than the best shots I have gotten yet on the automatic mode. I have to admit, we are going to Disneyland soon and I am not looking forward to lugging this thing around. The picture quality that I expect should highly compensate though.<br /><br />Aside from that, it is what I expected. It is a nice camera!

Neha sahni,4,"Good entry-level SLR, but didn't have as much direct physical control over lens focus and aperture as I would have expected",2014-12-18,N,"We had a Nikon D70S as our last camera.  That was a pretty solid performer for its time, but it's almost ten years old now.  We welcomed the opportunity to try out a Canon.<br /><br />Overall, the camera can offer point and click simplicity (when set to fully automatic mode).  However, it does allow the user who has an understanding of photography to manipulate the aperture and shutter speed, exposure values, and numerous other parameters that make creative photography fun.<br /><br />The autofocus is quick.  However, I was a bit surprised that the kit lens doesn't include a focus ring or a way to adjust the aperture manually.  If you want to manipulate those values manually, you have to do so through the camera's menus and interfaces.<br /><br />The kit lens isn't the fastest lens out there, but it was adequate for outdoor daylight photography and indoor portrait photography.<br /><br />Build quality was generally fine.  It felt pretty sturdy, but not quite as solid as the D70S did.  That is probably partially attributable to the lack of a metal frame.<br /><br />The photo quality was good.  In the ISO 200-400 range, we had no detectable noise in our photos.  The camera has a good RAW file output, and we were able to work with images in both Corel PhotoPaint and Adobe Photoshop.<br /><br />The battery lasts a long time, even using flash.  It beat the Nikon hands down there.  I've taken hundreds of photos and have not had to recharge the battery yet.<br /><br />I haven't really tried to use it for video yet because I have a video camera.  I will try to expore its functionality there and will update this review accordingly.<br /><br />Overall, this is a pretty solid entry level DSLR.  You get the simplicity of a point and shoot if you want it, good picture quality, and the option to explore creative photography by using menu and button-based control of various parameters.",11,10,Canon T5 Bundle v2,3

Kiran Koke,5,A great entry level DSLR,2014-12-01,N,"This is my first DSLR, but I have had a lot of experience with SLR cameras, and with a Canon Power Shot A720 IS digital camera.  I have waited until after Thanksgiving so that I could put the camera through its paces before writing this review. I used the camera in its fully automatic mode and got wonderful photographs and excellent video footage.<br /><br />For those who are interested in my more detailed comments, they are listed below.<br />- The Canon T5 in the budget version of the Canon entry-level DSLR EOS Rebel T5i.  I direct the reader to the review by Joanna Daneman for an excellent comparison of the T5 versus T5i.  The camera body is different,  particularly with respect to the screen, which is fully articulated, a touch screen and has a greater number of pixels on the T5i versus the T5.  However, I for one did not feel deprived using the T5.  The screen resolution was fine, I do not particularly like touch screens and being fixed rather than articulated was fine with me.  The T5i is a bit heavier than the T5, because the T5 uses a high impact plastic.  When one reads that the T5 body is plastic, one can get the false impression that it is made from a cheap brittle plastic of the sort that one finds in a toy, but this not the case at all.  It is more like the plastic of a Glock pistol.<br /><br />- The camera comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens (and so does the T5i).  This a very versatile lens, which I consider to be very good for wide-angle scenery photographs, for portraits and for use at family gatherings where the subjects are generally less than 20 feet away.  It is NOT, however, a telephoto lens.  The information on this site that lists the magnification as being optical 5.6x is wrong.  (The 5.6 number seems suspiciously like an f-stop number, so listing it as a magnification may just have been a typo of sorts.)  The zoom, given by the ratio of the focal lengths, is only 3.06, and at 55mm the object on the screen is, as I measured it, about half what one sees by eye at the same distance.  There is a magnification setting that allows one to view the image on the screen at 5x or 10x, and at 10x what you see may be 5.6 times what your eye sees, but I do not consider the 10x to be optical magnification.  The take-away is that you will need a telephoto lens if you want to magnify distant objects.<br /><br />- I found the auto focusing to be fine, but it did hunt a bit and was not extremely fast, but fast enough for my purposes.  The auto focusing can be turned off.  The camera also comes with Image Stabilization, which I used and found to work perfectly.  The zoom is all manual, which I believe is the case for all cameras of this type.  It was motorized on my Canon Power Shot A720 IS, which was nice, but I was OK with the manual zoom on this F5.<br /><br />- The camera ergonomics were good with good finger grip and with all the buttons easy to use.<br /><br />- The camera has a good viewfinder as well as a screen and to save battery life it defaults to the viewfinder (you have to turn on the screen when you want to use it).  However, in the video mode you can only use the screen.  For video you have to focus using the shutter button (operated with your index finger), but then start video filming using a button actuated with your thumb.  I found this a bit cumbersome, but with the benefit that you could take a fully automatic photograph while in the video mode by just pushing down the shutter release all the way instead of half way when focusing it.<br /><br />- Operation and versatility - As noted, I used the fully automatic Intelligent Auto operation for Thanksgiving and found that it operated perfectly.  However, when things are less hectic the camera can be operated in either of two modes - the creative zone that allows the f-stop, \\""film speed\\"" and shutter speed to be all set independently, or with only one variable to adjust.  There are also several basic modes, which operate completely automatically, where the camera chooses all the best parameters for several different situations: portraits, landscapes, close-ups, sports (fast motion) and night portrait. These basic modes also allow some of the parameters to be adjusted, although with less flexibility than with when using the creative zone.<br /><br />- The camera comes with a 114-page paper manual and three CD's, one of which contains a 342-page manual.  The other two detail the image processing, download software and photo editing software that comes with the camera.  These can be downloaded and saved as computer files.  It also comes with an adjustable neck strap that you have to put on, the 18-55mm lens, a rechargeable Li battery and charger, a spring tension lens cap and the cable that you will need to download photographs to a computer.  (You can also download the photographs from the SD card.)<br /><br />- The camera does NOT come with an SD card, so if you are giving it as a gift you will need to supply one in order to use the camera. This should not be a problem as an 8GB SD card now can be purchased for less than $10.  The camera comes with only one rechargeable battery.  Fully charged and after having used the camera to only test it out before Thanksgiving with less than two dozen photographs and three short videos, I found I was getting a low battery indication after 24 still photographs and less than five minutes of movie footage.  This may have been a premature indication and I did not actually run out of battery life, but I will definitely be purchasing an additional battery. I also purchased a UV filter that I use to protect the lens.ifferent situations: portraits, landscapes, close-ups, sports (fast motion) and night portrait.

Chaithanya kumar S,5,Two thumbs up!,2014-11-30,N,"This is my first Canon as I have mainly been a Nikon and Sony camera customer. The Rebel is comparable to the other Nikon DSLRs I own and I haven't decided if I like one over the other just yet. However I do have to add that I am very much an amateur &#34;photographer&#34; who uses maybe half of the features and capabilities of my DSLR cameras.  I'm still learning!<br /><br />With that said, one of the features I like about the Rebel is how user- friendly it is, which makes it perfect for someone just starting a photography hobby. The menu is easy to navigate and most anyone familiar with basic camera functions would be able to figure it out. My suggestion is to just play around with the options in different settings. That always works better for me than reading the instructions.<br /><br />The battery charged up pretty quick and lasts very long. In fact I haven't recharged it yet after using it for a long time. I can't speak of the print quality because I haven't printed anything yet but I have no doubt that my pictures will be amazing.  And maybe it's just me being completely dumb but I still haven't been able to get the darn strap on the camera. No biggie.<br /><br />All in all, I really love this Canon Rebel and would highly recommend it for any entry level photographer or hobbyist.  It's light enough to carry around for spontaneous use and is priced well for what you get. Two thumbs up.",19,17,Canon T5 Bundle v2,4
Nikhil Shedge,5,Awesome Camera,2014-11-29,N,"I enjoy using this camera, and I am seriously a Canon fanatic.  I have all Canon printers, and my first digital Camera ever over a decade ago was a Canon.  This camera is a breeze to use and set up.  It fits in my hand nicely, and works right out of the box.  You will need a memory card, because the Base model does not come with one.    I've used this to take family photos at the park and my photos came out great.  I mainly use the Manual function and adjust the ISO accordingly to get the shots I like.  Sometimes when I use the auto setting, my photos looked \\""washed out\\"" or too bright.  You really have to play with all the different settings to get the desired look you want.    The settings are easy to change,  You just switch the dial to what type of shot you want to take, such as portrait, landscape, sports, etc.  Only the Manual option allows you to make ISO changes.    I sometimes prefer setting it to a higher ISO instead of using the flash.  The flash can create weird shadows and makes skin tones washed out in bad lighting.  The annoying thing too about the flash is it pre-flashes like crazy sometimes and makes people blink, especially when you are taking pictures in the dark.    I have a Sony Class 10 memory card in it and was able to capture all my pictures with no problem.  I had my wife and 10 month old in the park the other day taking pictures of the leaves falling.  I set it to manual and was able to do burst shots.  She threw the leaves in the air and I just snapped a ton of pictures.  The leaves were floating in the air and my kid was looking at them fall.  You just cannot capture shots like that on a point and click.    A 32GB Memory card in the default settings allowed me to take 3880 pictures.  You can also record in 1080P in 24 and 30 fps.    This camera is awesome and I really enjoy using it.",17,11,Canon T5 Bundle v2,1
Kamlesh kumar,4,Good starting point for those entering (or reentering) photography,2014-11-28,N,"I underestimated the camera . . .and how long it would take for me to understand how to use it. I am no there yet. It's been more than 20 years since I bought a Nikon 35mm camera, and, I knew the game had changed radically. The weatlh of automated features, controls, and options packed into the Cannon EOS Rebel T5 camera is a bit daunting to me. You should know, and I imagine already do, that I am pretty much a novice at this point despite spending several weeks with this camera.<br /><br />I take the hype that this camera is &#34;Perfect for families, budding photo enthusiasts and first-time SLR users alike . . .&#34; pretty much at face value, and from talking with several photographers, I sort of know that the EOS Rebel T5 is a good camera for those types of folks. The array of automated choices and features makes it easy to start taking  movies and photos right out of the box. Well, right after you purchase and install whichever memory card you opt for intially.<br /><br />Using the preset options for photo and video, I found the camera easy to use and the image quality quite acceptable. Having subsisted on camera and tablet phones for too long, I am overall quite pleased with what this basic Canon camera will do.<br />But it really is essential to venture from the basics and try different modes and settings. One great aspect of digital photograpy is that you can quickly review (or preview) the image or video, try something different, check the result, and keep experimenting. That is the phase I am in with this camera, and I suspect I will be here for some time. For me, I have to use something before the instructions make sense, and that backwards approach seems to be paying off with this camera. I installed the PDF manual on my PC and keep checking it after each bit of experimentation.<br /><br />It is clear that I will need a telephoto lens in the near future, as well as another HD card, for starters. It is going to take months to sort through the features, jargon, and specs. The mass-produced hard plastic shell feels fragile, and I caution anyone to use the camera strap or weight your tripod. Some of the onboard photo-editing features seem a bit clumsy but certainly functional.<br /><br />I assume seasoned photographers are going to be coming from a different perspective and looking for more features and options. If, like me, you are just finding your way, this camera seems like a good starting point considering its features and price.rgon, and specs.

Indhumathi,4,but IMHO is better than Hero,2015-08-21,N,"I've had this for 3 years now. Its a tough little guy. Nikon's experience in underwater cams shows. In my last trip, for some reason water seeped inside, enough to see the battery and some drips coming out. The cam continued to work, until the water became too much, and it went into safety shutdown. I thought its a goner for sure. Then I took the battery out and left it out to dry. After a day, there was still fog. 2nd day I left it in the sun and hot car. It looked dry, and I powered it up. LCD came back, but the cam didn't. So I left it out for more drying in the sun. Still had some fog. By 4th day, no more fog, powered it up and everything worked again! I am sure there's some big thoughts put by the designers to have 2nd or even 3rd line defense.<br /><br />This first version, the pic quality is so-so, but IMHO is better than Hero.

So, when considering an underwater camera, trusting Nikon quality was a given. I've had two of these so far - I had to get the first one replaced because it was fogging up (condensation within the camera), and Nikon sent me a replacement. The first time I took the replacement camera underwater, it took in full water. And I'm only talking a couple of feet deep. Ruined all of my vacation pictures of Aruba. Do yourself a favor. Buy the Fujifilm Finepix underwater camera. It's much cheaper, and I've had absolutely no problems with it. It takes great pictures.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,1

Nikita das,1,"Then the worst happened. The ""said"" shock proof camera fell off ...",2015-04-28,Y,"I have previously owned Canon, Sony and Samsung cameras, but for my desired water/shock proof one, after a research I ended up making the choice for a Nikon. My mistake? It looks so...<br /><br />After a few months of using, the camera started showing problems, although I followed all the maintenance instructions. Often, when turning on the camera, the image would not show up on the screen, which remained black. Since after turning it on and off sometimes it would work, and because I needed the camera, I kept using it for a while.<br /><br />Then the worst happened. The &#34;said&#34; shock proof camera fell off a table from a height of less than one meter. Ever since, the image from the lens has never shown up in the screen anymore and more over the screen itself has been cracked, apparently inside.<br /><br />The camera was not thrown somehow, with any kind of force. It just and simple fell off a table of a lot less than the advertised &#34;shock resist when dropped from heights of up to 1.5 m&#34;.<br /><br />Since I bought it during a trip outside my country, the warranty did not cover it and I ended up without my camera... This way, I would like to show my disappointment with Nikon products, which I’ve chosen exactly because I had the impression to be stronger than other brands, but it turned out that a product offered as being 1,5 meters shock proof got unusable after a fall of less than 1 meter in hight.",3,2,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,3

Naresh Kumar yadav,5,Great Little Camera For Daily Use,2015-03-28,Y,"Pretty good overall but it died 2 years in with daily use of 300 to 1200 photos per day. I used it in rain, snow and high heat. The flash basically shattered inside the glass cap on the flash one morning. That being said it was a great camera for two years and I used it way beyond its usual limits that most will use it. For the tourist or person who will take 20 or so photos a day you will love, love, love this camera. I had some trouble with focusing close to micro items that were white on white backgrounds but usually could fix that by putting something in the photo to have the camera focus on. Other than that I had no issues. The camera was great. I have moved on to a much faster SLR camera with higher MP but the new camera is a LOT bulkier and I have not gotten used to the extra bulk more than a year in. The speed makes up for the bulk but I find myself thinking back to this smaller camera for ease of use and the fact that I don't have to worry about it in bad weather. While I don't ever see myself heading back to this for my job needs I wouldn't think twice about buying it again for personal use.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,3

manish k.,2,Be very careful with this model or it fails!,2015-02-26,N,"This camera was purchased to replace a Canon waterproof camera while in Hawaii.  We were disappointed. The underwater colors are not as true to life as the Canon afforded us.  The Aw100 also doesn't photograph well in darker venues, such as a hula in a restaurant.  The Canon had handled that just fine. It may have been the Nikon 16mega pixel vs the lower mega pixel of the Canon. However our main gripe was the door that is supposed to be waterproof.  You have to be extremely delicate with this door.  At first it clicked twice while closing and you have to have a fingernail that is sharp enough to hold down the center of the nob switch as you rotate the dial shut. Then we noticed it wouldn't click, or it would click once. The camera had been used only 4 times underwater when this started to happen.  I feel like the fact that we paid around $350 for this camera was way too much for one that has to have a part repaired yearly to be sure your pricey battery isn't fried and your SD card isn't destroyed. I read of the fogging issues and though we didn't experience that, it is just more evidence that the case is substandard.  We snorkel on top of the ocean surface so it was never exposed to any low depths that can cause failure. Though I have been a Nikon owner since 1980, with 4 digitals in recent years, I do not intend to buy another so called waterproof camera from Nikon ever again.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,4

Satishkumar P,4,Great camera for vacations!,2015-01-24,Y,"I have been using my camera for a few years now and it has gone with me on numerous vacations.  The waterproof aspect of it has been great!  I have had no problems with camera malfunctions and the buttons are easy to operate underwater.  The small wrist string that comes with the camera is very small so I would suggest purchasing a separate strap.  Additionally, I would suggest buying a strap that floats if you plan on going in the water because the camera does sink.    The picture quality is nice for what the camera costs, but pictures, especially those underwater, sometimes look less vivid.  The easy auto mode generally works well and can detect when I enter the water, but it sometimes does not do the best job with focusing.  The built in GPS feature on my camera does not seem to work, but I don't mind.    The thing that bothers me the most is a feature that changes the picture that is being viewed whenever the camera shakes.

It is watertight and dustproof.  It survives occasional drops.  No flimsy cover on the lens breaks as the lens is always behind a hard glass window.

Good,5,"Christmas Gift for a ""Sportsman""",2014-10-16,Y,"I purchased this product for my boyfriend for Christmas back in 2012. Now, what you must know about him is that he is a \\""Sportsman\\"". Hiking, camping, fishing, kayaking, ice-climbing, rock-climbing, surfing, hunting; he does it all. He was constantly borrowing a relative's camera, one only 'shock-proof' and needed something durable, waterproof, freezeproof, and so much more. He needed something as close to intensive-action-proof as physically possible... and I am pretty sure we found it in this camera.<br /><br />He has taken it almost everywhere since I first gave it to him and it has taken hits from higher falls than it is rated for, functioned in sub-zero temperatures, and even taken a 'slice' from a pocket-knife (thrown haphazardly into the outer shell) and has kept on ticking like a champion! Do I think it will continue its operation indefinitely? Of course not; nothing is that durable! However, for the next several years I can see this camera continuing to be his constant, electronic companion. The photo quality is fair enough (minus some distortion inherent in most underwater cameras) and can take a brutal beating. If the one I purchased for him goes bust he will probably find himself with an identical replacement in his Christmas stocking on some (hopefully far-off) future holiday season.<br /><br />The only reported downside he claims there is is the glitchy 'shake-to-shoot/switch-feature'. It was very hard for him to figure out how to use it and was not consistently operational.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,4

Abhishek kumar,4,Definitely water and shock proof,2014-09-18,N,"I received this as a gift. I spend a lot of time outdoors and traveling, and take a lot pf photos. For a point and shoot with a few macro settings, this doesn't take the best simple pictures. Especially indoors. But for outdoors enthusiasts--backpackers, climbers, water-people, this is a really good camera. It's definitely durable--I've used it (and dropped it) bouldering in Red Rocks, NV, and floating in the Dead Sea in Israel. The waterproof-shockproof claims are legit. It's just that the picture quality is not always the best, which may have to do with no mechanical protection to the lens. But this is an extreme outdoor camera, so that's to be assumed. I will say that I have not used the GPS feature, nor do I want to. In fact, I really don't think it adds anything to the unit, other than price and less battery life.

Murali,1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA OR ANY NIKON PRODUCT,2014-09-15,Y,"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA BECAUSE NIKON DOES NOT GIVE A S*** ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMER.  I bought the camera 2/2012, only used it a few times underwater during travel. The camera was not turning on 5/2013. I paid $149 to send the camera back to Nikon for repair since it has passed warranty time. The camera was sent back to me 3-4 times not repaired. During which time I called, and emailed Nikon asking why the camera was sent back to me still not turning on, and for status update, wasted a lot of time hoping to get this camera repaired. Eventually, in December 2013, half a year after I started the repair process, and 3-4 times after re-mailing the camera back to Nikon, Nikon sent me a AW110 (I assume refurbished) as a replacement for not be able to repair the AW100 I originally purchased and sent for repair. I used the AW110 for the first time March 2014, the camera took a few pictures, and a short video, then couldn't be turned on again. I sent the AW110 camera back again for repair. At first, Nikon said we have to charge you again for repair, I explained this was a replacement camera for a previous repair job. They finally agreed to take a look at the camera. A few weeks later, I received the AW110 in the mail, NOT TURNING ON, as if nothing has been done about it. I had the 6 months of nightmare repair experience of 2013 flashing in front of me, finally decided I have had enough, and filed a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, and a few other relevant organization.

Soma b.,4,Great After Fixing,2014-08-31,N,"I waited for several months before the review because I wanted to be sure that the camera didn't have any &#34;bugs&#34;, particularly since several reviewers had a problem with the display blanking out.<br /><br />I tried the camera in the pool with no problems with &#34;watertightness&#34;.  I also used it as an auxiliary camera on land.  The photos that it took were excellent - that is, with the exception of flash photos which were pretty washed out.  So I decided to just use it without flash, and it worked well.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months when I took it on a Caribbean cruise when it was about 9 months old.  I followed the directions for making sure that no salt water got on the seal, and it worked flawlessly.  For about 45 minutes of snorkeling.  Then the screen went blank.  My first thought was that water had leaked into the camera.  But there was no obvious water inside.  Then I noticed that the camera's &#34;on&#34; button glowed, which led me to believe that it was still working; just the display wasn't working.  So I continued to use the camera in LITERAL point-and-shoot for the rest of the cruise.  When I got back after snorkeling and was able to get the SD card out, I found that it indeed was taking photos, and great ones at that!<br /><br />When I got home from my trip, I contacted Nikon warranty support - the camera WAS still in warranty.  They had me ship it to the repair facility, and within a reasonable time I got it back - all fixed!  Not only was the display now OK, but it took great flash pictures.  Now the camera worked like I've come to know that a Nikon should work.<br /><br />Bottom line, the camera takes wonderful underwater photos, and Nikon repair service is very good.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,3

I bought 2 extra batteries anyway. The only waterproofing I need is from Oregon rain, and it does fine. I do like the water-seal, though -it's good dust-and-sand protection in the desert.

S.GOPI,1,"Great image and video, not so good underwater.",2014-07-17,Y,"I have had this camera for just over a year now.  At first I loved it.  Like others, I found the battery life to be very short, but could manage it, so I was ok.  I took it to the Bahamas for my 20th anniversary last year and loved the image and video quality.  I took it snorkeling daily for a week.  Often we were in the water for 60+ minutes at a time.  I never had an issue.<br /><br />Fast forward a year to our Mexico trip.  Before going, I checked the battery life to make sure it did not need to be replaced.  I also checked that the seal on the battery/memory access door was still good and hadn't dried out or been damaged in any way.  This would be the 1st underwater use since the Bahamas trip.  On the 1st day of the trip, I took the camera out to the beach and into water that was only 2 feet deep.  The camera leaked and was ruined, along with all of the plans I had to video things like snorkeling in the Yucatan Cenotes.  Oh, and of course it is out of warranty now too.<br /><br />I am VERY disappointed.

I could not be more satisfied with this camera until this year on my trip to Maui. I took it snorkeling for 4 days straight and then it flooded while paying in the surf. I could not believe it. Sent in to Nikon for repair and it was suppose to cost an estimated $167. I opted out and will be buying the newest version later this year plus a warranty this time.

Akkas Seikh,1,Don't use this in the water,2014-06-16,N,"I got this camera for the specific purpose of taking pictures while snorkeling. Used on my first trip 2 years ago and it worked fine, although it seemed like there was water inside the seal of the camera. I was VERY careful (this was my second waterproof camera, so know how to soak it in fresh water before opening and making sure it is clear of sand) with this camera. Just took my 2nd snorkeling vacation and on the first day the screen died on me. When I opened the camera to remove the card I could see there was water drops at the bottom of the battery and around the seal. Also noticed the connection for the cord behind the door appeared to be corroded.<br /><br />I left the camera door open and in an air conditioned room (it was humid in Hawaii) overnight and the next day it worked again. YEA, problem solved. Nope. Took it in the water and there was condensation inside the lense and the back screen didn't work again.<br /><br />I called Nikon and they said to send it back but that it sounds like customer error. It cost $137 to send it in to be fixed, and it could be more, depending on the problem.<br /><br />I took good care of this camera and barely used it outside of 2 snorkeling trips. It is very disappointing to have a $300 camera go bad after so little use, for which it was intended. My pictures were good, but having the camera be unable to take 2 trips in the salt water is unacceptable. I'm not going to have it fixed.

Ambika,5,Can't be without it,2014-03-29,Y,"I misplaced this camera recently for about a week and it seems like everyday is was exasperated to not be able to get the shot I could have gotten with it but couldn't get with either my DSLR, Nikon 700, or with my very good and handy compact Canon S95. I bought this camera mainly to use when I didn't dare take one of the other cameras out in so much water. It is even nice not to have to be concerned about the rain, or the wet updraft from a waterfall, let alone at the beach, the river, the ocean, kayaking, rock terrain, sand, dusty riding or hiking. Yes the lens stays behind it protective glass that is itself quite will protected by the frame protruding just adequately beyond it. The other main attraction was the dropability. I was impressed by the shock-resistant aspect. I brag that I can drop it about the distance of my height onto any surface. But I can't get myself to intentionally do that. Still. I feel confident of its durability. I am also glad to have the GPS onboard. When I was considering ordering it, I was concerned about whether the resolution would be satisfactory, so, I chose to buy a refurbished one. The warrantee sounded good enough to take a chance. If I had known how much I was going to be using it and enjoying it, I would have bought the brand new one instead. But, I am very pleased with this refurbished one. No problem! One of the reasons that I can hardly stand to not have it at hand at all times is because it is so easy to take a really close shot. I am a beekeeper and I have been trying to get close-ups of the bees with the other two cameras and haven't been able to do with them what I can do with this one. The resolution isn't as good as I would like to be able to get eventually, but it is much better than anything that I have gotten at the beehive previously and the images that I send to the newspaper look good in print. This is the third water camera that I have gotten, and by far the best so far. I am very glad to have this at hand. Oh, and by the way, almost every time I open and close the water-tight door to the battery and SD card, I realize how much I appreciate the technology of that door and its latch and remember that comment about one of the reviews that criticized the latch as overly complicated and difficult to use. I get a really satisfied feeling from closing this particular latch that seems to have the feel of closing a submarine hatch. And opening the latch with only one hand is a skill that is pleasing to be a master of and takes little effort in accomplishing. And yes, if you guessed, I relocated the missing camera in the pocket of my beekeeping jacket. Now to get some close-ups of the kittens that are just beginning to get a little tiny bit of their eyes open. Of course, I can't get quite as close to them as I get to the honeybees that I can be almost touching with the lens and fill the frame with the bee and get fairly good focus and detail. Good enough for most uses, at a price that you wouldn't expect to be getting gallery quality, anyway. Yes, I did get the orange face. Sometimes I am really glad when it is so easy to find. In the beginning, sometimes I couldn't find it because I didn't see any orange face anywhere. That is when I learned to always set it monitor down. That side is all black. I like the looks of the black better, but the orange is handy and it is good for me to set the monitor face down to protect it from anything damaging it from above. Oh, and I really like how well it rides with me when the strap is around my neck. Excellent that it wears like a necklace, secured at with each end of the strap at a side of the camera instead of the wrist strap kind of tether. It is so easy to wear and to just lift and shoot. Easiest of any compact camera that I have ever used. It is when I am wearing it, though, that I would prefer that it had a the dignity of a black face. But, such a good image buddy, I can't complain.

Although my original was stolen (long story, since been replaced) I have been very happy with its performance. I am a pretty outdoorsy person and it is really great to have a tough camera that you can just toss in your bag or slip in a back pocket and not have to worry about it. It holds up well, I have dropped it once or twice, usually due to excessive showing off.. Along the lines of &#34;check out my sweet camera&#34; followed by a toss to a rather un-expecting person who attempts to &#34;think-fast&#34; generally involving some sort of water hazard for extra shock when they botch the catch. It takes good quality pictures and really like the GPS geo-tagging abilities. Underwater pics turn out really well as long as the water is fairly clear, I even dropped it down and ice fishing hole and caught some fish in video mode. I don't really scuba dive, but have wore it around my neck for a full day of snorkeling going up to 15ft deep and never had an issue with it. I am more than satisfied with it as a whole, the only down side I think is the zoom capabilities but I was well aware of that before entering it into my wish list. Generally speaking whenever I find a good shot where I would like a powerful zoom I'm in a place where I would not have lugged a camera any larger or less durable than this with to begin with. So its nice to at least be able to take a picture home with me, even if the lens is smeared with mud. Plus if I ever want to go capture that perfect picture in the future I will have the exact GPS location, even the direction I was facing when i took the picture originally.

I ride a motorcycle and often (more than I care for) get caught in the rain.  I don't scurry to put away the camera.  It's still working like a champ.  I also took it to he beach and went swimming with it... all good.  Just be sure to follow the instructions. If it gets dirty or in salt water rinse it off thoroughly and THEN dry it completely before you open it (I let is sit for a few hours after getting wet before I open it.).  Be sure the gasket around the battery compartment is clean.  If it's not clean and smooth water will get in.. then you can just throw the camera away.,1,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,2

It is out of warranty so I have no recourse but to warn others.  We went to Cancun recently and I took it into the pool and it was never more than 2 feet in depth...yet, shortly after getting out, I saw evidence of water intrusion.  The first evidence was the condensation in the lense...I tracked down some rice and put it in the rice to hopefully forestall any further damage, but after 5 days in the rice, I removed it and it won't even turn on.  So, if you expect to get great pics out of the water, it does that well, but I would never take it into the water...you will have no way of knowing if it is waterproof until it is too late.

It still works, but useless without the screen. Nikon nor BB would honor refund and hundreds of posts about the same topic in the forums.  Considering that I was so diligent and focused on NOT getting a leak and ensuring clean seal, it is a clear manufacturing defect that it failed. So much for warranty.<br /><br />Not surprising that they no longer sell it. Total P O S life despite an otherwise great camera. Awaiting 2/11/14 release of AW120 to see if it's any better.

Suman V,5,My favorite Camera,2014-01-14,Y,"I have had this camera for just shy of two years as of this writing. I initially bought a refurbished unit here off of Amazon because it was $100 cheaper. The camera I received looked new and in box. I have had many Sony Cybershots only to have their lenses fail on me, we had a Canon and could never get a clear picture with it. We bought a Nikon d60 DSLR and loved the freedom and features, but found it to be too bulky for most of our activities. This Coolpix was the answer, and being waterproof it was great with kids around.<br /><br />I love having photos tagged with GPS. The image quality is better than any point-and-shoot that I have owned. It is fun to take the camera to the beach and act like you forgot it is around you neck when going in the water; other people look at you expecting to see you freak out, but then they freak out when you just start taking more pictures.<br /><br />We went to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and had a great time. We got pictures and video of our dogs swimming from under the water. One thing the strikes me with this camera is that it is the only camera that I haven't babied and protected - yet it still looks new and works perfectly.<br /><br />The battery life is short when the GPS is tracking your locations. I only turn that feature on for trips and things that I want to geotag. Getting extra batteries doesn't cost much and makes it possible to always have a charge. My D60 has an amazing battery that I almost never have to charge, so that was one surprise with this camera.<br /><br />I don't find the menu to be difficult for the most part. There are times I can't find some features, but they aren't usually features that I use a lot. The maps are not very in depth, just land and water. It is nice to be able to see markers where all the pictures were taken.<br /><br />I do like that there is internal memory and that it can copy to a memory card. This is useful when I've forgotten to put a card in the camera. I just wish the memory had been larger.<br /><br />I have never had any trouble with this camera; with leaking or anything else. There are times when I am on the wrong settings and I get blurry pictures, but that is more user error than a camera issue.

I don't usually drop my equipment, but if I should happen to slip, it has some measure of protection against the shock of falling, even if I don't.  I liked that it was a black color that didn't scream &#34;waterproof&#34; like some bright yellow camera would.

I thought maybe I could work with it, but alas, the next time I attempted to power it up, same thing. After several more attempts, I came to the conclusion it was never going to work and as much as I hate to I was going to have to send it back. Praise be to AMAZON...

Abhishek Anand,4,"Great pics, not waterproof, lens always exposed - dried water droplets or dirt on lens glass can mar pictures",2013-12-27,Y,"Takes great pics. It is NOT waterproof. I use it for kayaking, not diving. It never gets submerged in water, but it is in a watery environment (I keep it in the chest pocket of my life jacket that I am wearing). On a particularly rough day, it did get pretty wet just in my chest pocket. That day, the inside of the battery compartment got wet; I didn't know until the next day when I was checking my gear and opened the battery compartment to find the terminal on the battery a bit corroded from the little bit of salt water in it overnite. The other problem with camera is the glass on the lens is exposed all the time - it does not get covered when the camera is turned off. It gets dirty, and also if the camera does get wet, then the water droplets dry on the glass and you can see them on your pictures. So - you have to check the glass in those conditions, and buy and carry something to clean the glass. This reduces its functionality in a watery environment bec the water environment is usu one where you are busy and can't fuss with things so much. On a dry environment, I would just check the lens in the morning and clean it if needed -so that was one more thing to check but not such a trouble. A positive-it did get dropped once -onto a carpeted surface - and it worked fine afterwards.<br />Would I buy again - yes, but if a &#34;waterproof&#34; camera comes out with a covered lens then I would prefer that one.",1,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW100 16 MP CMOS Waterproof Digital Camera with GPS and Full HD 1080p Video,2

Vinay N,4,Much better battery life and still images than GoPro,2015-08-13,N,"I purchased the AW110 to take with me skiing and snorkeling in instances when I couldn't/didn't want to bring my SLR.  I previously owned a GoPro Hero 3 Silver for the same purpose, but I got rid of it after experiencing very poor battery life.  The AW110's battery life is significantly better than the GoPro - I can easily go multiple days shooting stills, or a full day shooting short videos on a single charge.  Image quality is good for a compact, and still images are significantly better than the GoPro.<br /><br />I rigged a chest strap for skiing using the included camera strap around my neck, a Fotasy NSQS Stainless Steel Screw (available from amazon) in the bottom tripod mount, and a bungee cord around my waste attached to the Fotasy Screw.  Video quality is surprisingly good, however the GoPro is better suited for this purpose since it has a wider field of view.<br /><br />When I was shopping for a replacement for the GoPro, I also considered the Olympus TG series, which receives marginally better reviews than the Nikon AW series cameras.  I ended up buying the Nikon because it significantly cheaper.  In retrospect, the Olympus may have served my purposes a little better with the addition of the optional fisheye adapter, which is sold separately, but for the frequency that I use the camera, it wasn't worth the extra expense to me.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,5

Saswata,2,Not worth the money. Nikon should forgo all the baloney wi-fi and GPS stuff and make a truly waterproof camera.,2015-08-09,Y,"I thought with a name like Nikon, I was making a smart purchase. For years we used the Kodak Play Sport. Every once in a while that camera would distort a picture or video, and was only safe down to 10 feet. So we decided to get serious and spend more than $150 bucks on an underwater camera. Though I thought I did a lot of research, I obviously did not do enough. This camera costs about  $240, almost 100 dollars more than the Kodak (at that time). I did like that it had a wider angle of view, and it has a really nice mic pickup. However, it tries to do way too much with confusing menus, and hard to press buttons (especially when wet or wearing ski gloves). It also requires its own proprietary USB cable. Furthermore you cannot charge it without pulling the battery out and putting it in the charger, so you are constantly opening your waterproof camera. The Kodak could use any standard USB cable and charged with any USB charger or plugging it into the computer. Everywhere this camera went, I also had to bring the clunky charger and &#34;special&#34; USB cable. Arrrgggghh. I did like the big display on the back, and the pictures were definitely better than my old PlaySport. But then it happened, it leaks, not much, but enough to show condensation on lens and digital display on back. This of course ruins every picture you take. You should know I have had the camera for a year and a half. It has never been submerged more than 5 feet deep, and has taken little to no abuse. It shows no sign of damage, not even a scratch. We were using it in about 2 feet of water at a lake, taking pictures of a splashing baby. One minute it was fine, an hour later someone got it out of the swim bag and it showed condensation all behind the lens and LCD on back. I am going to contact Nikon but I have seen from other reviewers here and on other sites saying this same thing happened to them, and Nikon won't stand behind their &#34;waterproof&#34; product. If they do, I will update my review.  UPDATE 7/13/2016 - Wet camera issue fixed by placing in bag with silicone packs. Got camera out again this summer, Brought to neighborhood pool, 5ft down, recording kids jumping in...did great. Brought home to look at pictures and there was condensation on screen again and it would not power up. Placed in bag with silicone packs again, but this time it is truly dead.

Video is crystal clear and the blur reduction seemed to work fairly well.

I've taken basic photography, so I am familiar with setting shutter speed, exposure time, etc., but this camera, more often than not, takes blurry or overexposed images.  Additionally, the lens fogs quickly.  The macro function is horrendous unless you set the focus mode to manual, and only then, does it take mediocre macro pictures.  If I could return this, I would, but I can't because it was purchased via a grant which means the money would go back to my university's departmental funds, leaving me out of a camera.

soffia,2,CoolPix AW110. Not a winner in my Home Inspection business.,2015-04-04,N,"After researching for what seemed to be days I finally concluded about a year ago that this was going to be my camera that I primarily use for business as a home inspector as well as a general contractor. During an average home inspection I take between 125 and 300 photos. When I do two inspections in a day, well, you do the math. It is a lot of inspections. My inspections take between 1.5 to 2.0 hours on average. Obviously a large or specialized home will take longer. So I need a camera that takes photos quickly, accurately and clearly as I use these photos to go back over the information gathered when writing the report as well as uploading them into the report for the client. I purchased the camera from Costco, who sells only the best brands and models of things which we have experienced over the years. within the first week the flash stopped working no matter how dark the area or room was. The only two options on the camera is off and auto. No constant flash. So I discovered when I cycled the camera off and on then the flash would work on the first few photos before staying off again. With my busy schedule it just seemed that I never had the time to take it back to Costco and before long I was beyond their 90 day return policy that they have on electronics. So I just dealt with the camera as it was. a few months later the camera would just freeze up and I would have to pull the battery and put it back in because the camera didn't even respond to the power button. over the past week it began to freeze up after every photo. And it was on a day that I had 2 home inspections which totaled about 425 photos. You do the math. I lost close to 45 minutes in having to cycle the camera 100s of times throughout both inspections. As soon as I came home I did some research to purchase the Fuji XP80. I hated to have to do this as I really liked everything the AW110 had to offer. I loved the camera. Just the issues with the flash and freezing could not be tolerated. Even if myphoto taking were merely personal and a hobby they are not acceptable. I know that so many who have owned this camera have not experienced this and I only hope I was the only one because it could make a great camera even for the professional who needs a good digital camera for their business.

DHARMENDRA YADAV,5,A very good waterproof camera,2015-04-01,Y,"This is a very good camera, better than I expected. Easily fits in a pocket, water proof, takes video as well as still pictures. I notice a small amount of distortion on the far side edges of the pictures when at full wide angle (making people at the edge of photos appear slightly fatter). But for the price and ease of carrying a small waterproof camera around on hikes and outings, the edges can always be cropped. Note to photographers: No, this will not replace a high grade SLR digital camera. But it is better than many amateur cameras. I am a hobby photographer, and fairly picky about quality. I have several cameras. This is the one I grab when I'm outdoors taking casual shots, especially in bad weather. A note about the lens - Nikon sells an attachment to go on the lens, but the attachment covers the auto focus hole! Without the attachment, the lens has no protection - just keep your fingers away. There is a newer model, the AW120, but it cost more and in my opinion, is not as good as the AW110. So compare the stats.

Madhuri Sharma,5,Love this camera for underwater and land use!,2015-03-18,Y,"Great camera!  I've had this camera now for a year and a half and haven't had a single problem with it.  When I was researching it, I was a little concerned about all the reviews that talked about the screen going foggy or it not working after taking it in the water.  I've taken it snorkeling many times and last summer used it while trying to boogie board.  It has worked great every time, even taking a beating in the waves and sand!  I always make sure I follow the manufacturer's directions and rinse and soak the camera in fresh water after taking it in the ocean.  I am very careful to let it dry before doing anything with it.  Even when I got sand in the locking mechanism (and spent quiet a while working it all out very carefully) it has worked perfectly every time.  I can highly recommend this camera!  And it takes great pictures out of the water, too.  The macro lens takes awesome close up shots, the underwater shots are great (when I can get the fish to stay still...) and when I'm in the right place at the right time, the sunsets are gorgeous.

Amazon Customer,1,Died the first time we used it underwater,2015-01-27,Y,"This camera had a few flaky issues from the start.  Sometimes the screen would not turn on, the flash would flash even when you turned it to &#34;no flash&#34; mode, and on the picture playback mode, it would automatically flip to the next photo if you tipped or tapped the camera.  We took it to Hawaii a few weeks after purchase, really looking forward to taking underwater shots.  It died the first time we used it underwater.  The screen would not turn back on.  We dried it with a towel, then opened the battery/memory card slot.  It was wet inside.  There was water in the ports.  What a huge disappointment.  For $300, this camera was not water proof and never really worked correctly.  We sent it in for repair and will see what happens.  I will not buy another Nikon camera.

Chakri,5,"Very waterproof, shockproof, and takes great pictures!",2014-12-07,N,"I bought this camera to serve several purposes...one was to have a camera that is waterproof.

We got dumped (I highly recommend you buy the floating strap) and thankfully, the camera was attached to me and my floatation vest...when we were fished out of the water, my camera was still attached and working fine. No damage to the internal parts at all! Secondly, my camera serves as a way for my kids to also take pictures...it gets dropped quite a bit and it is still going strong. Lastly, I wanted something that would take pictures for our vacations, trips, adventures, parties, etc that wasn't so heavy as my Canon, and it does the job perfectly. Takes high quality pictures (and videos) that I use for our photo albums.

Nagma,5,Couldn't be happier!,2014-12-03,Y,"I personally love this camera. I took it with me on a 3 month trip abroad and it went pretty much everywhere. I used this camera underwater on multiple occasions and I didn't have any problems with it. Of course, the efficacy of the water seal will depend on how you take care of your camera; sand or dirt would probably negatively impact the seal, but you're provided with a convenient little brush to help you clean. Also, you should make sure you soak your camera a bit in fresh water after you've been using it in the ocean and then dry it off properly. My order also came with a super convenient floating strap, so that was a pleasant and unexpected surprise.<br /><br />Overall I think the picture quality is great, you have a lot of different options that you can select in order to change the file size of the photos. You can also change the resolution of the video if for any reason you don't want to shoot 1080p. There are a couple of features that were useless to me but may be useful to other people, like the depth gauge, however those can be turned off if they bother you. This camera is super quick to focus and takes great pictures even if you're on a bus/train, or you don't have time to stop walking and take a pic. There are a lot of useful settings on this camera, and the auto feature is great. However, if you're a more experienced photographer you can change a lot of stuff and shoot more manually.<br /><br />The video on this thing is great and the sound quality is pretty good; there is a wind reduction setting but I personally found that turning that feature off led to better audio. The audio underwater is also pretty good, granted it will get a bit distorted if you're repeatedly taking it out and putting it back into water. Zooming in isn't the smoothest while you're recording, but its one of those things that you get better at with practice, also there is a slight buzz noise while zooming but it's only detectable if you're filming in complete silence.<br /><br />This camera is the perfect size to fit in your pocket comfortably. The screen is pretty big and the buttons are comfortable to use. I will mention however that the screen picks up small scratches relatively easily, but you can just cut up a phone screen protector if you have one lying around and put that on if you think it'd bother you. It really isn't that noticeable unless you're looking for it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this camera. I think it's a good value in terms of image quality as well as versatility. I'm sure professional photographers could probably find some faults in it (as with any camera), but if you're just an average person or you don't want to spend all that money on a gopro then I think this is perfect. You pretty much have all the same capabilities of a gopro except you can take way better photos (whether or not you actually know what you're doing).",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,3

I used the Nikon for a year, At the beach, on the boat, outside, without incident. At 12 months, 1 week I took the camera in the pool to photograph my daughter getting her Scuba certification. The pool was 10' so the camera may have been to 10' but in reality about 8'. When I went to download the the pictures, I realized there was moisture in the lens. I dried the camera, opened it carefully, took out the battery and card and looked inside for moisture. I did not see water inside the camera but the lens was fogged so I contacted Nikon and sent the camera to their repair facility on the east coast, Precision Camera. After a month with no email or contact I called Precision Camera and they said that for $135.00 they would fix the camera to new specs. After 2 months I received the camera back saying unrepaired due to corrosion. They kept the camera for 2 months, with no communication despite my repeated unreturned (except for 1) phone calls, and now I have a 1.2 year old, worthless, \\""waterproof to 59' \\"", Nikon Coolpix. I never used this camera in an extreme manner and always treated it like my ELPH. The very first time it went in the water the waterproof Coolpix drowned. My ELPH met a similar fate when I dropped it overboard but that was my mistake, the ELPH is not a waterproof camera. I purchased this camera and sacrificed with the images but thought I had the piece of mind that if I ever dropped the camera in shallow water it would be OK. It was not OK in a pool at 8'and not OK with the nonexistent Nikon warranty and or customer service. I am a 51 year old responsible adult who makes informed purchases and takes care of my equipment. When I purchase a camera I expect quality pictures, good functionality and good customer service after the sale. NIkon / Coolpix fails at all three.  I contacted Nikon USA again after I received the camera back unrepaired. I explained to customer service that the camera was literally 2 weeks out of warranty when it leaked at 8' in a pool and I asked if there was any way they could help me. The email response I got was:  \\""Thank you for contacting Nikon Support. Per our conversation,your warranty has expired on 6/28/2014 records show your AW 110 was sent in on 8/8/2014 and returned on 10/2/2014. At this time because your camera is considered out of warranty.     Thank You,    Shawntera     Nikon Support.\\""    I am not exactly sure what this response means but I think it means I am \\"" S O L \\"". I would think that Nikon might want to keep me as a customer with at least an apology and perhaps a coupon to help with another camera but obviously this is just wishful thinking. Their customer service is truly nonexistent much like the quality of this camera.",4,4,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,2

KASHMIRI KALITA,1,Just don't get it wet ...,2014-09-29,N,"You've got to be skeptical when a product has almost as many one-star reviews as it does five-star.  Nonetheless, I've been a professional photographer for almost 30 years, so it's second nature to take care of my gear. Plus, I've always had great luck with Nikon cameras including their old Nikonis underwater film cameras, so surely, none of that would happen to me.  Right?  So I bought this camera a year ago for a Class IV whitewater canoe trip.  And I've done one more similar trip, since.  In between, I may have used the camera on land a dozen times with the accompanying opening and closing of the battery door to charge the battery and/or remove the card.  And it has worked just fine.  But today, I used it in 12\\"" of water.  Literally, twelve inches.  Afterwards, I opened the battery door to remove the card and water poured out, not a stream, but steady drips.  Even worse, and more ominous, the lens and screen were fogged up from the inside.  So it's now baking in the toaster-oven at 140 degrees, overnight.  Surely, there's a better waterproof camera out there.  Hopefully, the upgraded model is better.  Hopefully, the folks who are buying that one are coming back and reading the reviews of it's predecessor.  And hopefully, I'll feel better about this thing when I remove it from the toaster-oven in the morning, but I'll never trust getting it wet, again.  Follow up: After 48 hours in the toaster oven, the camera is dry and seems to work OK. However, as you'd expect there's a residue of tiny water droplets on the inside of the lens.  They probably won't show up unless I'm shooting towards the light source.  Bottom line: Don't buy this camera with the expectation that it will be waterproof.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,5

Bhavya,1,Major Disappointment!,2014-09-16,Y,"I am incredibly disappointed. I have an earlier version of the Coolpix AW110 and it works well and does what I need it to do. I was pretty impressed with it as a point and shoot camera. I decided to get this one for a beach vacation we were going on and it worked okay - the option to change the pictures instantly was a neat feature. But sometimes the camera would freeze in the middle of taking the picture. If I popped the battery out (which wouldn't work if we were scuba diving), then the camera would begin to work again. I contacted Nikon about this issue and the response was that I needed to make sure I had a proper SD card that would have the required speed to work in the camera. So I bought an upgraded high-speed SD card (even though I was pretty sure the one I was using should be sufficient) and the camera died completely. I tried several different batteries to make sure it wasn't a battery issue and it is still dead.<br />Don't know what Nikon did (maybe they added too many features for the size of the camera? - Maybe I just got a lemon) but I am so disappointed with this camera that I will probably never purchase a Nikon item again - going back to Canon items.",2,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,2

harsha chilakamarri,3,NOT FOR ADVENTURE!,2014-08-07,N,"I did my research and found that this camera was going to be the best &#34;Bang for my Buck&#34; in terms of an outdoor adventure camera. I had read the many many reviews on how the camera has about a 50/50 chance of either being superb or failing miserably. I took the risk and unfortunate fell victim to the latter.<br /><br />This camera performed extremely well in dry conditions and had many very exciting and useful features. Upon dunking in the water it captured the underwater world but, upon my third use of underwater use it started to fail. The area in which I discovered to fail was the weak housing on the bottom left corner of the camera. All that holds it on is a weak adhesive that deteriorates when exposed to moisture (...hmmm that makes sense). The first indication of failure was when you were able to see the faint crack where the frame meets the housing at the edges. Then when using in water and a warm environment the lens encasing would fog up due to moisture breaching the system. At that point I decided to retire the camera from adventurous activities (Rafting, swimming, surfing). When the camera finally did fail it was when I tried to get an at water level picture. It was then that the screen went purple and the camera failed.<br /><br />Unfortunately when sent into be repaired, the camera was deemed void of the warranty because it passed a pressure test.<br /><br />I did love this camera and its capabilities are wonderful but, when it comes to performance it is not assured that this piece of equipment will hold up as an underwater camera.<br /><br />Bottom Line, I made the gamble and lost.

Tech.

It truly is water-proof. Though in my case, it's only been through shallow water and occasional splashes, I wasn't really looking for, say, deep-water dive resistance anyway.<br /><br />There are only two minor drawbacks.<br /><br />(1) The factory-shipped battery's capacity; it only lasts up to about 2 to 3 hours of continuous use outdoors (depending on the level of usage). But carrying around a spare battery solves that \\""problem.\\""  Note that some manufacturers' compact models do not offer interchangeable batteries (only not-easy-to-remove, built-in battery). I'm glad Coolpix has interchangeable batteries among other bells and whistles.<br /><br />(2) The lens window in front seems to collect or attract tiny dust or pollens sometimes. Though I don't particularly think it is a flaw of this model, on occasions, those tiny dust particles get picked up subtly by the HD video recording.

NITIN YADAV,5,"A solid, waterproof point & shooter",2014-08-01,Y,"I bought our Nikon AW110 just over a year ago in preparation for a family vacation in Florida. We were destined for the usual tourist destinations--including Disney World, Sea World, and Daytona Beach--and I wanted something that I could keep out & at the ready rain or shine, surf or turf. The size (approximately 4.25&#34; x 2.5&#34; x 1&#34;) makes it easy enough to carry around or put in a pocket or purse.<br /><br />Out of the box, the camera takes lackluster pictures. You have to go into the soft menu to increase the image quality (up to 4608 x 3456). The image quality is quite respectable once that is done. At the larger image sizes, it allows you to do decent 8&#34; x 10&#34; prints--even with a bit of cropping.<br /><br />On the waterproof side, we have gotten it wet with no ill effects. It has survived water rides at amusement parks and a couple excursions into a hotel pool. Best yet, we have some great underwater pictures.<br /><br />Make no mistake though. This is not a DSLR replacement. The shortcomings for this camera are a bit harder to explain. It is, after all, a relatively affordable and small point & shoot camera. To keep the size & price down, Nikon has used less sophisticated & more compact optics & imaging chips and a compact battery pack. All of this is pretty standard fair in a camera this size, but it does impact the overall performance of the camera.<br /><br />Action shots & quickly taken photos can create varying levels of blurriness in your pictures. To put it into some perspective, we (primarily me & my 11 year old daughter) took about 80 pictures at Sea World's dolphin show. I deleted about a dozen pictures due to our own framing issues; like cutting off a dolphin's head while trying to capture its jump out of the water. I deleted about another 15 pictures due to blurriness. The roughly 50 remaining pictures came out great. We have some excellent pictures with dolphins jumping six feet (or more) out of the water, and even the water droplets streaming off of the dolphin's tale are clearly captured. Flash memory is pretty cheap these days. So take a lot of pictures. You will be rewarded.<br /><br />And to revisit my earlier comment on the battery, the battery life can be lackluster. You will probably want to buy & carry a spare battery for longer day trips--especially if you plan on taking a fair number of pictures (100+). A single batter will probably suffice for shorter adventures where you will only be taking a couple dozen pictures.<br /><br />In closing, it is a great, pocket-sized & waterproof camera. I would not hesitate to buy another one. Overall image quality is quite nice. But, its size & price point can make it behave a bit like Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde: some of your pictures will be stunningly clear and others blurry.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,2

I received an email 3 days later stating that there was water damage, that it wasn't covered under the warranty and that they could repair it for $125.  So, a camera that is advertised as waterproof, that was only used 3 times in a year, and never taken below depths of 2 feet, is not covered for water damage which isn't supposed to happen in the first place?

This practically ruined all my photos due to the water swishing around the lens and causing blurry photos. It wasn't even ONE meter deep. As if that was not bad enough, a few weeks later the whole screen started to fog up really badly, and obstructed my view of the shots. Now both the lens AND the screen fog up.

Amazon Customer,1,Not waterproof!! And poor customer service makes it even worse...,2014-07-01,Y,"Despite what the name says, do not count on this camera being waterproof.  I have owned numerous Nikon cameras over the years (I actually own three Nikon DSLRs right now), so I have been a long-time supporter of Nikon.  This camera, however, really let me and my daughter down.<br /><br />I bought it for her right before a trip to the Caribbean and wanted it to be waterproof since she loves snorkeling.  It came shortly before the trip.  Nice size, seemed easy to use and set up.  She took some pictures on the way there and they looked very good (as good as you would expect for a point and shoot).<br /><br />The problems started about five minutes after she entered the water.  Before going out, she carefully checked to make sure everything was sealed up as it should be (it was).  Shortly after hitting the water, the lens fogged up--water had gotten in to the camera and there was nothing we could do about it.  It still took pictures, but they were all foggy.<br /><br />My first mistake was to not send it back to Amazon on time--that left me dealing with Nikon warranty.  I filled out the on-line form, explaining what happened and why it was a warranty claim.  I gathered the receipt, original warranty card, etc. and dutifully mailed it to them in California and waited.  A month or so later I got a letter saying because the repairs were not covered by the warranty, I needed to send them $150 to pay for them.  There was no e-mail or other address, just a fax number or a telephone number where I couldn't get anyone who could help.  I wrote a letter explaining all of this and what happened and tried to fax it--the fax number didn't work.  I tried for more than a week to get the fax through--no luck.  So now they returned the camera to me, still broken--and without all the warranty paperwork I sent in.  I bought my daughter a Pentax Optio WG-3--bit clunky, but it's survived other underwater trips without a problem.

Rahul,4,"With so many cool features, it's like a Swiss army knife of cameras!",2014-06-08,N,"I purchased the Nikon AW110 as a camera that I can take anywhere--kayaking, snorkeling, and hiking in any weather. While the latest model, the AW120, boasts a faster lens and other upgrades, I found a Nikon-refurbished AW110 that was too good to pass up (check out Adorama).    I've run the AW110 through several comparative tests that tell me I made a good choice. For starters, pictures taken in \\""macro mode\\"" are very good. In fact, I consider the tonal range, sharpness and color superior to my older point-and-shoot, a Canon SD790IS--see my gallery pic.  While there is some blurring and color-fringing towards the image borders, that's to be expected for a lens that is shooting through a piece of glass designed to withstand 2.8 atm or 59ft.  Additionally, I found the landscape mode just as good with pleasing colors and a lot of detail for such a small lens!    Feature-wise, the AW110 is similar to other point-and-shoots, I won't go into them all. However, there are a couple features that really stand out and make this camera distinctive. In GPS mode, the camera acquires satellite data just as quickly as my Garmin Etrex 20!  And once GPS recording is enabled, coordinates are embedded as exif data in every photo. From there, it's simple to upload my pictures to Flickr and see them on a map. I also like that at the click of a button, this camera will display my position on a map, along with streets, businesses and other landmarks. Combined with the compass, I think you could quite literally navigate with the AW110!    Is the AW110 `all wet'?  I've read a number of reviews that claim the camera leaked an failed underwater. Those criticisms are hard to ignore--and I initially decided against this camera. However, after watching several comparisons of underwater cameras, I decided this Nikon delivered the best image quality, and the locking mechanism gave me a sense of security--so I took a chance. After snorkeling for about an hour, I noticed condensation inside the screen--but no liquid water inside the camera. So what happened exactly?  I think that humid air inside the camera condensed on the screen (which is directly in contact with cooler water). After I dried the camera off, didn't take long for the condensation to dissipate.    So what's not to like? There are a few details that I don't like on this camera. First is the LCD screen--in bright light, it's dim and hard to see. However, it has 5 brightness settings, which may help. Secondly, shutter and multi-selector buttons are rather vague and may be hard to use with gloves. But, I suspect my complaints are partly due to the waterproof design, where thicker screens and waterproof bladders under the controls are necessary. Some things take getting used to.    If you've read reviews of the AW110 and AW120 and worried about picture quality, let me say this camera is quite capable of shooting excellent pictures--for a point-and-shoot!  It may take a slightly longer learning curve to master the controls, but once you do, you may enjoy this camera as much as I do.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,3
Amazon Customer,2,Great for awhile,2014-06-08,Y,"I got this camera last February for my god daughter (2 years old) who loves to take photos. I figured a rugged camera would be great for her in case she dropped it or spilled on it, etc. It actually worked great for that and she loved the camera. When we would go swimming, we always took it to the pool for underwater video and pictures. It went underwater a couple of times each month until June. We went out island hopping in the Philippines and took it with us. For the first half of the day the camera worked great. Suddenly the LCD panel went black though even though the camera had never been opened up while we were out and about. The camera still powers on and it sounds like it is focusing but it doesn't take a shot and we can't see anything on the display. When I got back home the photos that were originally shot while the camera was still working were still safely on the SD card but the camera seems to be unusable. That is only after about 4 months of use. I searched online for what might be the issue and came across multiple comments on DPReview that said they also had the LCD fail on them. So it appears there is an issue with this camera. It's unfortunate because other than being unusable now, it was a great camera for a few months.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,2

I've taken some great photos and videos with it.  So far, it's definitely been waterproof.<br /><br />My issue with the camera is with the high speed video mode, which gives you slow-motion output.  In the bright sunlight, it looks very good, but only lasts for a very short time.  In the case of the 4x speed, you get 15 seconds before it switches back to normal mode.  I'm curious why they put this sort of limit on the camera.<br /><br />My other problem is that the light setting appears to be set to bright daylight when in HS.  This means that you can't shoot HS indoors, or in heavily shaded areas.<br /><br />If I'd known about these issues, I'd have looked at other camera options more closely.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW110 16 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with Built-In Wi-Fi,2
Ankush kumar chaudhary,1,Big Mistake,2014-05-30,Y,"I'm the kind of person who really takes a look at all the reviews for something before buying. I'm planning a trip to AK, and I wanted to upgrade to something small that has the ability to take 1080p video. The fact that this is supposedly pretty tough and able to go underwater is cool as well, as I do quite a bit of snorkeling.<br /><br />So, taking all that into consideration, I bought this little piece of crap and was super upset. I can't give you any insight into it's features because the stupid thing wouldn't turn on. I kept getting a white screen with a little exclamation point in a red circle. Since there is no mention of this anywhere on the internet, I figured that maybe the battery was exhausted. So, I charged both of the batteries overnight. Apparently, sometime after I plugged in the Nikon battery, the charger stopped working. This happened when I took it out of the box as well. It blinks for about 5 minutes, and then stops blinking, which is supposed to signify that it's fully charged. Nope. So I let it sit overnight, and nothing happened.<br /><br />However, while I was looking up info on my red exclamation point issue, I found many many many complaints about the fact that this doesn't usually work underwater like it says it's supposed to. The reviews on Nikon's website were awful, and reviews on other camera-related sites were similar. I don't think this camera is worth the hassle, so I returned it for a Nikon Coolpix L820.

I tried to set up different functions and used the most simple auto function. Still black. Tried to shoot a couple of pictures and videos, when I played back, they were all dark. I owned more than 10 digit cameras and this was so unusual. I contacted the seller and described the problem. They only replied and asked did you charge the battery?.... That was frustrating.

sheela soundarrajan,1,Do Not Buy This Camera,2014-05-14,Y,"Purchased this camera based on its advertised capabilities, “waterproof to 59ft”.  After two days of owning it and normal use while on vacation in and out of a pool, never going below 2ft, the display on the back stopped working.  The camera still functioned without the display but there’s not much you can do with it.<br /><br />OK, stuff like this happens … it must be a defective camera.  Returned the camera to Nikon’s warranty department in New York, who then sub-contracts and ships it to Precision Camera in CT, who then sent the camera back to me stating “Returning unit unrepaired, unit is beyond economical repair due to liquid damage”.<br /><br />Upon talking with Nikon Service about this, their reply “sorry nothing we can do”, Precision Camera makes the call; you will need to talk to them.  After pointing out that the camera was used in a normal manor and failed, your sub-contractor (Precision Camera) says it cannot be repaired and that the warranty is with you Nikon for replacement, their reply “too bad, thanks for being a Nikon customer”.<br /><br />So, buyer beware!  If you are counting on this camera to perform while on vacation you might want to look at something else.  If you are looking for a camera that you can use in a pool, you should definitely look at something else.

naveen,3,A Nice Camera - but not User Friendly,2014-04-16,Y,"After using the camera a bit - I can now comment.  On the positive side the camera takes nice pictures and uses a standard USB charger, it is nice not to have to carry a separate charging device.  However, the camera and its features are not very user friendly.  The flash options are either Auto or Off.  There were a couple of situations where we had a bright background and needed to use a flash and could not - because there is no &#34;flash on&#34; option.  The WIFI is a big disappointment because it requires the use of a proprietary app to work.  I loaded the app on my phone and on my tablet and the ICON disappeared from the menu on both devices.  When I tried to re-install the app - it would not because it was already installed.  The ICON eventually reappeared on my phone - but not on my tablet.  Both are android.  Also, the PC app will not let you download pictures to the computer.  Bottom line - I am shifting the chip just like with my old camera.  With regard to the GPS - It works - but it  needs much improvement.  The GPS coordinates will transfer to windows, but the location data does not.  Also, the coordinates do not transfer to Google Maps.  The map coordinates were read by only one of my map apps.  I had to manually insert the places into the pictures.  Regarding the location data.  For one, it can not be updated - says that right in the manual.  This is crazy because locations change all the time.  Also, we just took a Caribbean cruise and had no location data outside of the United States.  Nikkon needs to work more interoperability into its features.

I have taken it underwater on several occasions and as it did wonderfully then, I assumed it would be the perfect camera to take on my trip to Hawaii- unfortunately this was not the case.

Kartika Kumar,5,Better Than I Expected,2015-07-27,Y,"At first I was feeling a bit skeptical towards this camera because some of the customer pictures taken on land and in water didn't seem to be of very high quality. I understand that the clearer the water is,the clearer the picture is, so I wasn't sure if the water was unclear or if the camera was the one causing the murkiness. Regardless, I bought the camera and I can say that the quality of the pictures taken on land are probably on par with an iPhone camera. You can see it in my picture of a really torn shoe. The quality of the pictures aren't terribly great but are decent for the price of the camera and I got what I was expecting. You could say I grew fond of it over time :)  As for the video aspect of this camera, I started with low expectations and when I turned it on, it was really quite amazing. The specs on amazon say that this camera is in 1080p HD but the pictures from the camera didn't quite reflect that. In any case, I now know that it was referring to the video and that was most likely a mistake on my part. The videos I recorded were definitely in 1080p and I was happily surprised by this. I did, however, notice that the camera generally makes the colours in the video a slight bit more vibrant than in real life. It's not really a bad thing. It's also a little bad at taking videos and pictures in the dark, and as the darkness increases, the quality decreases. I haven't really messed with the different aspects of the camera, so perhaps there is something to fix this that I don't know of yet. Regardless, I ended up taking the camera with me to Seattle for an event some time ago. If you want to see the video as a reference for quality, here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IF7VG-uays  Overall, I'm very satisfied. I've had it for a few months now and everything is still going perfectly :) I attached a photo above and below water for referencen the videos. When you look at the videos on the camera, the quality looks absolutely stunning and amazing. But as you can imagine, the larger the screen it's played on, the worse it looks in terms of quality. When watching the videos on Youtube, I'm slightly dejected that the quality deteriorated a little, but I'm still overall satisfied :) Hope this review helps you guys make up your mind!",2,2,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,2

We used the camera beforehand for &#34;land pictures&#34; and it  appeared to work fine.  I dropped coffee on the  manual .  I called to try to buy a new one and got a &#34;snarky&#34; rep who told me Nikon had gone green and that one was not available even if paid for.  I asked her how to print only the English pages....highlight or cut and paste as I could not make it work and she said no way...had to print the whole thing!  So much for  going green for the rest of us..came to over 300 pages!  So I had to read and take notes.  The rep thought this was totally ok and not odd.  This should have been the red herring for what was about to come.  On the first day, the camera functioned perfectly for 6 hours and quit.  That was it for the trIp: dead as a doornail.  No charging and changing of batteries fixed the problem.  No soaking in non-ocean water.  Dry as could be inside and sd card had pictures until that point.  I had no computer contact with the outside world, no camera store to go to and no telephone assistance.  This was the idea of the trip.  So, I was reduced to buying at double the cost the disposable underwater cameras that go for $12 at  Walmart to $25 at the only store on the island.  I could not help myself from composing a Dear Judge Judy letter in my mind over my lemon camera.  When I returned to the mainland, I called Nikon.  I can only advise if you call for help, to be sure to have every part of your camera and charger set with you as well as only have Nikon batteries and good sd cards.  The first thing they want to blame is that.  None of her tricks did the trick so I have to send the camera in......I purchased through Amazon who only gives you 1 month to return, but  we purchased it ahead and had no way of testing it in an ocean before the trip.  The rep said they were sorry for my &#34;inconvenience&#34;......the trip of a lifetime halted on first day ....it was a snorkeling trip of 8 days.....guess they won't give me a new trip!  I hope they will pay for the disposable cameras but I doubt it.  I have to pack everything and send it back.  Saga to continue but I wanted to forwarn everyone....a touch of lemonitis at the wrong time.  Worked 8 hours.",2,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,2

You're on your own they basically tell me and give me the Nikon number to call. $300 bucks I paid for this POS, folks. 5 times, that's all I got out of it. Worked great the 5 times I used it. That's $60 bucks a use. Took about 100 pictures, $3 bucks a picture. What a bargain.  I can tell you if I come across Wolfe's Camera Shop on Amazon, I will run like the wind.

I have had this camera for just over 6-months and it has worked perfectly.  My job is rough on cameras, I crawl under homes and into attics, lots of dust and lots of mud.  It doesn't matter what the weather is doing, my job requires pictures.  My cameras take a beating.  It is not unusual for me to have one break in just 2 or three months.  I usually buy the two and/or three year warranties but it is still time consuming and a pain to send them in for repairs.  So far, this camera has worked perfectly every time.  I have dropped it several times, even from the top of a one-story home (into the grass, not a paved surface) and it hasn't missed a beatr yet.  I don't like the fact that I have to open the battery cover to mass download my pictures but understand that if you want a water proof camera it is necessary.  It is fast and easy to operate, even with one hand.  Although I usually charge the camera every night, I have done two inspections (approx. 250 pictures) before needing a recharge.

I bought this camera for a trip to Hawaii and I only used it once so that I could dabble in some marine life photography. Because I'm a photographer I had to get the best quality pictures I could at the most reasonable prices, in a very short amount of time (I procrastinated while picking a camera). This was my first time doing underwater photography, and it turned out quite well, thanks to this camera. There were some pictures that were completely white or completely black because the camera didn't have time to figure out what f stop and shutter speed to use, but that wasn't a big problem. A lot of the pictures were blurry because the camera takes the picture about a second after you press the button, and by that time the sea critter has moved on. I took about 400 photos in an hour, so having a lot of blurry ones wasn't that big of a deal because there were plenty good ones. I would definitely buy this camera.

Nagarajan M,1,Waterproof camera is not waterproof - moisture forms inside the lens even AFTER it was repaired under warranty,2015-04-24,Y,"I purchased this Nikon Coolpix AW120 specifically for the underwater capability before I visited Hawaii. Unfortunately, I was not able to use it for most of my trip because moisture formed inside the lens after the first time it was submerged (and I only took it to a depth of about 4' underwater). I discovered the issue while hiking the next day; the lens was completely fogged over, as was the display, and my hiking pictures were ruined.<br /><br />I called Nikon customer service about this issue. At first, I was told that the camera is actually only &#34;water resistant, not waterproof&#34; and that the damage would not be covered by the warranty. I had to point out to a supervisor that the camera actually has the words &#34;WATERPROOF 18m / 59ft&#34; written on the front of it. At that point Nikon agreed to let me send the camera in for service.<br /><br />Several weeks later I received the camera back, but the next time I took the camera underwater, the same issue occurred (and just like before, I was very careful to use the brush that is included with the camera to make sure there was not any grit preventing a perfect seal with the battery cover, and I allowed plenty of time for the camera to adjust to temperature changes). I was told that moisture forming on the inside is normal and not a defect, but Nikon asked me to send the camera in for service again. This is where I have a real issue with their customer service: I already sent it in once and the issue was not resolved. So now I find myself again traveling without a usable camera. I asked Nikon to instead send a replacement camera and I would return mine, or to at least send me a loaner to use while mine is being fixed for the second time. Nikon refused, and would not make any guarantees that this second time would resolve the problem.<br /><br />In the past I have been a very loyal Nikon customer. I own a P7000 and a D7000 dSLR as well as several additional lenses. But in this case, I think I would have been better off buying a GoPro, and that is what I intend to get as a replacement. In my experience, the Nikon Coolpix AW120 is not reliable. It is definitely not waterproof.",4,4,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,2

She played with it, put it in her mouth, hit it on the floor and took it in the bathtub while I took pictures at random times.  The WiFi worked well and the photos went directly to my phones Photos app.  Some of the photos were hilarious.  I soaked it and dried it as instructed and it didn't have a scratch on it.

Janardhan Reddy M,4,"Really is waterproof, drop proof",2015-04-13,Y,"Had Amazon stocked the newer AW 130, I would have ordered it to replace my AW 120 assumed lost overboard, I was content enough with the AW 120 to buy another or newer model. I recovered my AW 120 after it spent more than 2 weeks in 6 feet of water. Mind you, not only that long underwater; but with many scratches and three significant dents from drops mostly while on rough boat trips. The AW 130 is still not available here (almost tax day 2015).<br /><br />So why not 5 stars? At max resolution, file sizes are about 6Mb from a camera advertised at &#34;16 megapixels&#34; setup for largest image size. My lower res Nikon Coolpix had larger file sizes. The lens, while fairly sharp in full sun exposure, is still max 24mm optical so I end up cropping to get the image I want. Those cropped images seem flat. Next, I am using a UH-1 SDHC card &#34;approved&#34; by Nikon rated at 95MB/s. I must wait for minutes for my very fast PC to identify the few new images to transfer from the 32MB card using the Nikon-limited USB2 interface. Till Nikon catches up, I suggest you use smaller SCDC cards. The USB3 interface and UH-1 up to 200 MB/s card interfaces are a waste of $ since Nikon does not support, a long-term slow adoption Nikon issue. Last, I need geocoding, and welcomed the built in GPS. I suspect a firmware issue here.  For some odd reason, the metadata has a different GPS format than images overwritten with geodata. That conversion seems off. Hours minutes seconds is not the same as hours and decimal hours lat / long coordinates.<br /><br />If you live an active lifestyle, need waterproof and drop proof cameras, do not use low light photography, long flash or zoomed photos then this may be for you at a reasonable price versus the 810 series DSL with GPS or Nikon 1 options. If you dive, look at the Nikon 1.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,3

boscocap,5,Great underwater camera!,2015-03-31,Y,"Brought this on a shark snorkel weeklong trip in the Bahamas. My last Olympus underwater camera died in the middle of a snorkel so was looking for something new. After reading many reviews I decided to get this one. It lasted the whole trip and still works great. It took amazing pictures and great video. What I didn't love about my old camera was that it was not so simple to switch from picture to video while underwater. This camera has just one button you push to switch to video and one button to switch back to photos. It was really easy to use while underwater and swimming around with sharks. I was debating getting the GoPro since many people I know have that and love it and I'm glad I went with this camera. If you are planning on swimming with sharks I was told that some of them (such as the reef sharks I was swimming with) actually bite the GoPro cameras so our guide told us not to take them but said my camera was fine. One woman on the trip who owns a GoPro actually is buying this camera as well after seeing how great my pictures and videos came out. My only complaint is that the viewfinder got really scratched up after just a weeks use. I was banging it around a lot in a bag and on the boat but was still hoping it would hold up better. It doesn't affect the pictures though so it's not that big of a deal. also, the battery life was amazing. I bought extra batteries as back up and never had to use them.

Ashutosh kumar Banjare,5,Great camera!,2015-03-01,Y,Bought this for our vacation in St Croix USVI so I could take some underwater videos while snorkeling. My previous experience with underwater cameras were the one time use still cameras that took really bad pictures (several years ago.) I took a ton of picts and they turned out great - the only drawback was the photographer's (me) swimming abilities :(  I bought an accessory kit that included a float for it and used it every time I went snorkeling. I like that it was easy to unsnap the float when not in use. I also bought extra batteries and a wall charger. I recommend the wall charger  - didn't find it necessary to use the extra batteries but I'm sure the extra batteries will come in handy for camping trips without easy access to electricity. I will be getting the silicone 'jacket' for it as I think it will be easier to grasp the camera.<br /><br />I took some evening videos at our dance venue and they looked just fine.<br /><br />I was very careful with the door to the battery (you have to open it to charge the battery in the camera) which has to remain dust/hair/dirt free as it can spoil the seal and ruin the camera.

Ayanmasood,2,"Lots of features, but poor image quality.",2015-02-21,Y,"I've had this camera twice now, once in the form of the old AW-100, and now again as the AW-120.  I returned the old 100 because the camera had poor picture quality, but when I again needed a waterproof camera, I was lured to the 120 by the WiFi and geotagging features and because it could be recharged from a computer with a USB cable without removing the battery.  I read the generally good Amazon reviews and was influenced by some very reasonable reviewers who opined that picture quality was as good as could be expected from a waterproof camera of this size, so I bought the camera for its features, knowing the picture quality would not be great.  However, none of the features mean anything unless the camera takes good pictures, and the picture quality delivered by the AW-120 is miserable.  Whites and light colors are consistently burned and blocked outdoors in sunlight.  The screen is difficult to see outdoors in sunlight.  Zoomed in, the images look more like a watercolor than a photograph, blocked, pixilated with unnatural edges from too much noise reduction.  Taking the same shot side-by-side with an iPhone 5 (in a LifeProof case), anybody would choose the iPhone 5 image over the Nikon AW-120.  The 120 images indoors are as disappointing as those taken in daylight.  Although the white balance is okay, low light images all seem motion blurred in spite of the claimed vibration control, and they're grainy (noise).  Perhaps I just drew a bad camera because otherwise I can't understand how this camera could pass Amazon reviewers' muster with such poor image quality.  I kept it too long before critically examining the images on a screen large enough to judge them properly, a clear mistake.

Edwin Hillary V,4,Good Camera (even with the built-in rattle),2015-02-17,Y,"So far so good, but...I returned the first one I received because it rattled like something was loose inside. While waiting for the replacement I went to a brick and mortar store and checked their display model. It rattled. So I searched the web and found numerous comments about it rattling when turned off. Once turned on the rattling stops. The replacement model I received also rattled. Strange but it doesn't appear to be a problem. Other than that, the few photos I have taken are quick and look good when viewed on the built-in display. It rapidly changes to the appropriate scene setting based on what it sees. I also like that it lets you set a home time zone and a visiting time zone. I also bought the silicone cover to protect the case--I think a worthwhile purchase. Note that this model is now discontinued and the AW130 will be available in a week or so--for quite a bit more money. The only difference I see is an additional 41 feet of depth.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,3

Sree,5,"Excellent, excellent camera for snorkeling",2015-02-07,Y,"This is a fantastic underwater camera. I used it snorkeling in Bonaire for a week with ZERO problems. If you need bifocals like I do you will have problems adjusting the camera to get optimal video/pictures. I got excellent videos sometimes and OK videos at other times when I should have had fantastic videos but again this was due to my visual limitations. If you have great vision you will be able to review your pics/videos on the spot and should get excellent quality. When snorkeling the conditions change frequently mostly due to sunlight, sometime due to jellyfish, suspended sand, etc. and sometimes because of the item you are trying to film, so it's helpful if you can make these adjustments to the light balance, etc.<br /><br />Capacity is not a problem. I had a 64GB micro SD card and filmed video every time out (10 times) and only obtained about 32GB of film. That was about 10-15H of video.<br /><br />I didn't find the charging with the door open a problem with this camera.<br /><br />I am trying to think of something negative to point out about it and I cannot think of anything.<br /><br />The buttons are so easy to use/access while in the water and if you want a pic instead of a video you just depress the top button instead of the record button, there is not mode switch. The only minor negative and it was more operator error is that I would go to turn off the video and due to a fraction of a second delay with the light going out I would actually not turn it off and film stuff with the camera flopping around behind me. The worse problem this can create however is if you see something amazing and go to turn the camera on when you are actually turning it off from mistakenly not turning it off previously. So you might miss something that you thought you filmed. You just got to be careful and it's not the end of the world unless you wanted to document you getting eaten by a shark.",6,5,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,3

Satya Narayan Jat,4,Great camera just remember to zoom in,2015-01-12,Y,"We've had this camera for half a year now and it takes good quality pictures. Unless you're really planning on printing poster-size images, you can get better images by setting it to 8MP instead of 16MP. The waterproofing seems effective; we used it for 7 weeks in the UK and the Pacific Northwest of the US and had no problems. The wide angle lens is both good and bad. It does cause distortion towards the corners/edges, but that can be avoided by zooming in a little. Initially we noticed a lot of distorted faces before we learned to zoom if people will be towards the edge of the shot. Also, if you ask a stranger to take a picture for you, they may not notice that their finger is in the frame due to the wide angle lens (just a warning). We haven't used the wifi/gps features though.

Thakur Rama krishna,1,LEAKS.  Sub par photos.  Terrible in low lighting.,2014-12-23,N,"I'll start off by saying I have always been a huge fan of Nikon.  I have literally thousands of dollars invested in SLR gear and have been using them as a consumer and as a professional all the way back into the manual focus 35mm days.  With that being said, I can not say the same thing about their point and shoot cameras.  I am now on my 3rd, that's right... 3rd COOLPIX AW camera, two of which were replaced under warranty and one I had to shell out over $100 for repairs through Nikon... ALL due to the camera leaking.  I am not SCUBA certified and have not taken this camera anywhere close to it's supposed/advertised depth limits, 2-6 feet tops and that's probably rounding up.  All three cameras have been strictly used in swimming pools and on occasion on the beach (on the beach, not in the water).  The final straw most certainly is the 3rd and last replacement that leaked on the 3rd day of my seven day honeymoon in St. Lucia.  Fortunately, the SD card was not damaged so I was able to recover the photos that had been taken. Regardless, I was left without a point and shoot camera for the remainder of my honeymoon aside from my action cam and wife's super basic point and shoot.  I will definitely not be shelling out more money to get the most recent COOLPIX fixed.  I will most certainly never buy a Nikon point and shoot camera again.  Aside from the disastrous leaking with all three cameras, the images are muddy, the viewfinder is difficult to see in sunlight and the flash and auto modes are abysmal indoors  It amazes me that their semipro and professional SLR gear is fantastic, yet their point and shoots are absolute garbage.

This camera does 2 of the 3 things I want right now.<br /><br />CURRENTLY: The android app DOES NOT WORK on the Nexus 4 with Android 5.0. The wifi will connect with the phone but as soon as I try to view a photo or remotely control the camera the connection drops. At one point the app even switched its language to German for no discernable reason. This is a problem as phones across the board will be updating to this OS soon. My phone auto-updated, so though the app says it is compatible with the Nexus it is currently not. So, if you are buying this camera for this capability I recommend not purchasing until Nikon gets this fixed.<br /><br />Otherwise, I do like the camera, especially all the scene modes and also I think some of the post shot effects are kind of cool. Again, it would be nice to edit the photo on the camera then send to the phone for sharing.<br /><br />Once the android app is repaired I think this is a 4 star camera, until that point I put it as a 2.5-3 star camera due to the advertised functionality not working.",3,2,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,1

tn shailaja,3,Very disappointed. This is one of those worst case scenario ...,2014-10-26,Y,Very disappointed. This is one of those worst case scenario stories. My boyfriend and I were going a trip to Jamaica so I searched for an underwater camera. I was conflicted between a few cameras and read numerous reviews. This camera is said to be very durable and shock proof. Well that was not the case on this trip. I dropped my camera about 2 feet at most to the ground and the display screen stopped working on our second day of a 9 day trip. And since there isn't a looking hole to take the photos I had to wing it and just guess/hope that my photos were centered and actually taken. Not a good experience at all for a tiny fall.<br /><br />Besides the shock proof failure. The camera took good photos and handled going in the water.,3,3,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,4

DK,5,Two great options in one camera,2014-10-22,N,"We got this camera because it includes a panorama picture taking function in a waterproof body...not that you would necessarily want to do both at the same time.  The panorama feature is easy to use; you can monitor the subject as you move through the picture area, and you have a timing bar visible on the screen as you progress through the field of view.<br /><br />Haven't checked out the waterproof part yet.  It's rated to 59 feet, plenty deep for almost all snorkelers but maybe not enough for divers.  Also, it is rated for shockproofness to 2 meters (6.6 feet).  I haven't tried that out, either accidentally or on purpose.<br /><br />Upsides include a bright, live view screen, a 5x optical zoom range, wi-fi connectivity, video mode, and a bunch of other stuff that I haven't tried and probably never will.  The picture quality is excellent for the camera size, it fires up quickly because it does not need to deploy the lens mechanically, and there are a plethora of picture taking options which work well.  Unfortunately, there is no &#34;raw&#34; option.<br /><br />So far, I've loved this little machine.  Taking panorama pictures is lots of fun if you are new to it, and the quality of the images is very good.  I haven't tested underwater picture taking, but digital is the way to go because you can view your results immediately and make corrections, something you can't do with film.<br /><br />There may be a better camera of this type on the market at around the same price, but I doubt you will be unhappy with this one.  It's relatively easy to use, the picture quality is very good to excellent, it has lots of features, and it gives you lots of picture taking options that all work well.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX AW120,3

Sangeetha,5,Review of Nikon CoolPix Camera L330 Digital,2015-08-03,N,"I am in love with this product. I think this is a fantastic piece of device and a powerful gadget. It does what it is intended to do, i.e. to click powerfully crisp and original images taking in all minutest of features in it. One of the biggest features of this camera is the 26X Zoom which is quite handy when one travels to distant places and have to click distant scenery. Personally, I have used the Zoom feature to its maximum when I went to the Rocky Mountains recently. The Camera is having a 20.2 Mega-pixel Optical Sensor Resolution which gives a superior image quality.<br />Apart from the technical features the whole device is quite sturdy. This was tested the last day when my young cousin picked it up from the table and accidentally dropped it. I had my heart in my mouth as I picked my Nikon CoolPix Camera but to my surprise, it was working completely fine. It was a test of its robustness as was claimed by the makers.<br />I would suggest people to buy it if they are crazy photography fans, travel to distant places and are looking for a complete device with all latest feature. If someone is less aquatint-ed with professional photography, then there are less complex devices which are available for them.",0,0,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black),3

Lakshmi,2,Sad to say I was very disappointed in this camera,2015-07-20,Y,"Sad to say I was very disappointed in this camera.  After using it for 6 months with no issue, suddenly the camera would no longer upload pictures to my computer.  I called Nikon as it was still under warranty. First the representative wanted to know how old my computer was, it is only 5 months old, but I did ask why that would matter given the camera worked fine with my new computer up to this date.Then she said, maybe you need our Nikon software program installed into your computer.  This made no sense to me either since the camera was working without their software.  I did agree to download the software, but the camera still did not permit me to upload my pictures.  Finally, the Rep tells me to mail the camera back to Nikon (at my expense), make sure I insure it, and they will repair it. I also had to buy a box and packing to ship it back to them without damage-more money I had to spend.  I don't believe I should have had to pay for return shipping and insurance for a camera that is only 6 months old. I had always heard Nikon was a good camera and this model had good reviews, but based on my experience and Nikon's lack of customer service, I will NOT buy a Nikon again.",18,18,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black),4

It is a very good camera for the price, especially if you get it on sale; equal to or better than many more expensive cameras in this category.  It's simple to use as a Point-N-Shoot, but takes very high quality photographs as long as you don't need sophisticated set-ups, which for me is most of the time. I take it, in a waterproof bag,  in casual situations, such as camping and sailboat, where I don't want to risk my expensive SLR camera. and most of the time I get photos which are just as good, or better because I have it with me at the time.  I also like that it uses AA batteries; I just load it with non-rechargeable lithiums, and it's good for a lot of occasional shooting with no worries.  I have an extra set in the case it runs out of juice.  These lithiums have a long shelf life and almost no self-discharge; I can leave it sitting around for weeks, and just grab it when needed.  I do not use the video feature of this camera; it is lame.  Being of sound mind, I have a dedicated video camera for this, a Samsung HMX-F90, and don't use my still camera for video, though you can use the Nikon L330 for lo res video in an emergency.

Tried to get it fixed through warranty but Nikon USA will not authorize because the camera is &#34;gray market&#34; meaning not made by Nikon USA, perhaps Nikon China? I've contacted the seller and hopefully they will agree to replace it with a working camera, preferably one that has a US warranty that can be honored. If they don't agree, watch for another review post notifying purchasers to steer clear of this seller. I may not even be able to pay to get it fixed elsewhere, because most repair places send it to the same place that would do the work under warranty, and they will only work on US products.",1,0,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black),5

Lea,1,Not Useable,2015-06-07,Y,"I returned the camera because of several reasons.  I found the few pages of the start-up guide to be of little use – not even to show how to simply use the point and shoot features.  I found:  It will not work when used with a USB port hub.  The transfer cord is too short to use with a desktop computer that is in a under-the-desk or in a desk compartment.  There is no warning that it can’t be used without a memory card – only 3 or 4 pictures and it becomes not useable because it is out of memory.  I ordered a 32 GB memory card, installed it and the monitor read “Memory Card is Write Protected.”  With no instructions on how to clear the monitor, the camera was still unusable.  Maybe I am not too bright, although I have used computers and cell phones since their inception; I found the camera not the least bit intuitive.  I then downloaded the Owner’s Manual.  It was one hundred and eighty-four pages.  With no tech support number, and not wanting to spend the rest of my life learning how to use the thing, I called and the reliable Amazon rep was most helpful in telling me how to return it.",5,2,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black),5

Amazon Customer,4,Great zoom range and good low light capability but auto-focus is quite slow,2015-06-05,Y,"I bought this camera for the very good zoom lens builtin. Have used other cameras and been disappointed by their zoom capability. This one, when zoomed all the way out (default setting when turned on) is a lot wider angle than most, so is great indoors when wanting to include as many people in a photo as possible. It's also great for wide-angle photos of subjects in nature. Recently took it to the Grand Canyon and the photos from that trip are spectacular. Zooming in brings a subject a LOT closer and makes many photos which would look stupid in other cameras look wonderful with the L330. When zooming all the way in, the camera needs to be steadied against a solid object like a tree, a car, a post, etc. If you try to free-hand when zoomed in all the way, you will be disappointed because you will jitter the camera and blur the picture. When attempting to zoom in or out just a little bit, I find it difficult because the electronic control tends to overdo it. A knob to twist would be better than a lever to hold, but that's probably a feature for a more expensive camera.<br /><br />My one true gripe with this camera is the slowness of its auto-focus. It is nearly impossible to capture an action photo because, no matter when you press the shutter release, the camera will wait until you've missed the action then it will snap the picture. Often it simply gives up and takes an out-of-focus picture which is even more disappointing. Yes, I know I can get it to focus ahead of time my pressing the shutter release down half-way and holding it there then snap the picture at the proper time by pressing it down the rest of the way. I do that all the time. But often there are shots you just can't prepare for. If I could lock the focus at infinite and disable auto-focus, then I wouldn't miss any of those kinds of shots. Again, probably a feature for a more expensive camera.<br /><br />This camera also does quite well in low light situations. I've done direct comparisons of this camera with other brands and been impressed. Once again, you've got to be prepared to brace the camera against something solid because in low light the shutter stays open a loooooong time. You'll blur the picture if the camera isn't suitably braced.<br /><br />So overall I am quite impressed with the camera. I give it 4 stars.with other brands and been impressed.

It takes horrible pictures and costs my small clothing business money every day because my pictures are just garbage and I can't afford to put out the money for a new one.

The picture quality is much better- and sort of a hybrid of digital and film camera in terms of quality. I find much less distortion than on my Canon Camera. The pictures are  of course not as professional looking as a DSLR. But this is not DSLR. And for the price, it takes a really good picture.

User,1,SAVE YOUR MONEY… BETTER OFF WITH DISPOSABLE CAMERA!,2015-04-24,Y,"The constant little red box! I want to throw the camera OUT THE WINDOW! No, light is good enough! Outside, Inside, in the dark, in the sun! I purchased this one mostly to sell items & because, I had no camera for the upcoming Birthdays & events. THIS CAMERA IS TERRIBLE FOR THAT! It takes 100 times trying to get it to give you the little green box, so you can take your picture of a NON_MOVING item. Don't even try it for moving children at a party… YOU MISS EVERYTHING! The blowing out of candles, the hitting of the piñata. You need to be able to have minutes on end to get it to take a picture! I AM SO SENDING THIS BACK! If you can't even take a picture of a doll, without moving around your WHOLE house! And, picture in the dark, NOT HAPPENING! The battery compartment is crappy, I feel like I am holding in the bottom of a kids toy, to shove batteries in! GET A CAMERA WITH A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY! The zoom, I know once you get to tat middle bar everything after that is shaky & blurry on cameras. This one you get ½ of ½ way in your zoom & it is blurry pictures! TERRIBLE!  My camera broke (the flash stopped working). So, I needed a replacement & fast! I had the Nikon Coolpix p500, And, to be honest even that one did not make me 100% happy. (I hated that in certain lighting the pictures were terrible (Auditoriums at schools). And, you could not capture stars). But, I could take 100's of photos that were GORGEOUS! I could capture moving items! So, I wanted a camera that would meet my needs until I could buy another one that was 100% what I needed. And, then this would be used just for  the items I was selling.",3,1,Nikon Coolpix L330 Digital Camera (Black),6

Maybe it's just me but I find it hard to compose in the screen and in bright light conditions, the screen is hard to see, making it even harder to judge what you're framing up for your shot and what the image-lighting is going to look like).<br />Overall, a great camera for anyone who doesn't want to invest in a full sized digital cam like the D200 / D300 models.

My wife doesn't even have a cell phone! I still use the Coolpix, which was quickly repaired, although not until after our trip. On cruises, I keep it near the balcony door of our stateroom, for shots of the ocean, sunset, ships and passing sea creatures. It does a nice job. In all honesty. I had an early ELPH before the Nikon and it's lens got stuck too! While the Nikon may give a better quality, it's heavy to carry around on shore excursions and I do a lot of one-handed shots outside the window of a tour bus with the little elph.

I have had it for a few years, so I feel like I know it well enough to give the CoolPix L810 a decent review. First, it is easy to use and provides several functions that offer the photographer an opportunity to select options for just about any type of environment.  I love the video function and use it quite often. The quality of images is no better than other cameras that I had but no worse either.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that it tends to shut down and quit working when it is cold. I was unable to get good shots inside of a penguin house at the zoo because it was tool cold inside. Getting outside during the winter is also a risk. While it may work for a few minutes, a few minutes is about all you will get out of it.

There aren't any exterior parts.  Customer service is good and I only had to pay the first time.  What happens is I get some shots that look like a film camera has the film off-center, some of the picture comes through at the edges, and the rest is black.  I hope this is the last time because it's about a 2 week turn-around time from the time I send it to when I get it back, and I go through camera withdrawal.

Amazon Customer,4,Great Camera - slow in shooting.,2014-03-13,Y,"Hi! I rated this camera with four starts and not five just because I found one issue that didn't like.  It is that the camera is not very fast processing shooting pictures.  What I want to say is that the camera takes around two or three seconds to get ready to take a second shot.  This is not really nice when you are trying to take pictures of an event that is happening very fast (or faster than regular events).  I even set the camera for the sport events, and noticed that the camera is slow getting ready from one shot to another.<br />Besides that little detail, the camera is very compact, light, has good resolution, and contains many features that are still great to take great pictures.  I like the zoom, and it is of great quality.  I would recommend buying this camera if you are interested in getting pictures of great quality, indoor or outdoor.

Zainab,1,"Slow writing, slow focus and not correct acpect ratio",2014-03-10,N,"This camera does take wonderful pictures, great colors and the zoom is terrific but it takes so long to record the image to the flash drive.  You always need to remove the lens cap to turn it on even just to look at the pictures otherwise it'll give you a warning.  The thing that really makes me mad is that the aspect ratio is off.  This means any setting, any size you select through the menu is not going to fit on a standard 4x6 or 5x7 picture when printing them out.  You will always end up cutting the top and bottom off or the left and right sides.  I bought a Sony NEX for my girlfriend for about $100 more.  The colors a a little better but I was so surprised at how much faster it writes and the aspect ratio is spot on, so no more clipping or cropping of the pictures to fit the standard 4x6 or 5x7.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX L810 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 26x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch LCD,4

Vikram,2,You can do better,2014-03-05,N,"I have collected ( and used ) cameras for over 30 years. I picked up a Display Model of this camera last week for $89.99 so I couldn't resist. The idea of having a 22.5mm to 585mm with the Nikon name for that price was a no- brainier. The images looked pretty good on the screen when I shot in the store, I drove by the coast before heading home and shot about 60 different images as well as video. The camera was a Huge disappointment.. The images on the computer screen looked like they were make out of sand the grittiness was so bad under enlargement, I have old 4mp cameras that perform better. The edges are a bit soft on the lens, backlit subject create it to mis-focus and video zoom freezes randomly. On top of that it can take forever to find focus when shooting video. Avoid the headache, the Fuji fine pix s4200 is Much better. 16 mp is a big mistake for a small sensor, Nikon is not what Nikon used to be..I returned it.<br /><br />Update 3/7/14- picked up the Panasonic Dmc-FZ35 yesterday, far superior! check out that review and buy that instead.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX L810 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 26x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch LCD,1

Got it back and later noticed that flash would not work in low light or at night. Sent back in before 1 year warranty ran out, when we got it back it had a note attached to it saying that a liquid had gotten into camera and it is beyond repair. Also said that warranty was void because of liquid. The camera still takes pictures, just no flash. I complained and they investigated and found it was not covered by warranty.  Looks like to me that if it gotten wet, nothing would work. gave 2 stars because camera takes good pics, just not going to hold up and Nikon doesn't want to keep repairing it.

I took photos of my daughter's wedding just a few days after receiving the camera. My photos were mostly indistinguishable from those taken by the professional photographer they hired. I used it a few months later to take some beautiful photos on Vieques Island. My only complaint is the audio when using the camera to record video. The tiny built-in microphones have a poor low end, making everything sound thin. My cell phone records better audio. I wish it had some way to hook in external microphones. I do have a digital audio recorder I could use to record the audio and then sync it with the video, but what a pain.

Farah,3,Nikon customer service horrible,2013-10-18,Y,"So my camera dropped just a few days before warranty was up. to think it was in the bad and had a small little dropped and stopped working. wanting to be honest I said  that I dropped it. Paid about $60 us to ship it from Barbados to America. After having to call to find out my quote seeing their were taking so long, I found out why it cost around $180.00 us to get it fixed, I asked the representative why it cost so much,,,,seeing that all I had to do was put a few more dollards and get a new one,,,, she was uncouth, or lets just simply say not nice, and told me that was the price. May I add that their website is not user friendly and trying to contact them I found it easier to call,,,,, for me an international user that is not cheap.....soooooo I then received  a quote in the mail then I saw the breakdown that shipping was costing me around $80 somethingUS and I was like,,, if only the young lady had explained this I would have been more understanding as to why it came to that much. Mind you I used UPS shipping thinking I had prepared shipping back to Barbados, only to find out that, they gave me wrong information more bad customer service. To make a long story short I end up calling Nikon several times only to be met with either rough customer service representatives who do not understand international customers.  I had a couple people lined up who were coming to Barbados where I would get them bring it for me on their way back from their vacation in NY, but they simply take too long to give details in terms of repairs and how long something would take. All in all I want a camera company who can respond fast and be understanding when I have a problem...........the camera works ok, but like some I have to agree the focus takes too long and you get some blury pictures along the way, but the customer representatives leaves a bad taste in my mouth for Nikon...they need to take a leaf out of Amazon's book.",1,0,Nikon COOLPIX L810 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 26x Zoom NIKKOR ED Glass Lens and 3-inch LCD,1
Amazon Customer,4,Second worst cam I've ever owned. UPDATED,2013-10-13,Y,"Takes about a dozen (decent) pics before batteries die.  I've seen numerous web posts re the stinking battery life.  thin Cam should be recalled/replaced.  If they don't fix this, Nikon hasscrewed any future prospect of me ever buying another of their products.    UPDATE  Short story is, It was the batteries.   After writing the above review, I parked the camera on a shelf. After many months I ran out of the Alkaline AA's that were working fine in flashlights, etc. but not in the cam.    So I ordered another box of AA's but for some reason I had to get a different brand.  On a hunch I dusted off the L810 & tried it with the new batteries.  Well the new batteries are much better that the old maxells and the camera has been reborn.  I get hundreds of pics between batt changes now, long video tracks, Lots of Flash & good battery shelf life inside the camera.    I now give it 4 stars. I just don't think the menus allow for quick enough changes during fast changing events or situation, and the lag between pressing the button & the instant of exposure, ruins too many pics... and it takes a bit long to rearm between exposures.

Very bulky and heavy (4 AA batteries).    Hard to carry.    Always need to use both hands.    Special case needed.    3.  You need to cover and uncover lens by hand all the time.    Even when I download photos to PC.    Hassle.    This is only good when you pretend you have DSLR when you don't.    You have to pay huge inconvenience price.    I returned it and bought Coolpix S3600 ($99) and much happier.,0,0,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,5

Shiwam Sharma,1,"Others said not to buy the refurbished, I agree!!",2015-02-25,Y,"I purchased the refurbished and boy, was that my mistake for trying to save a bit of cash. Immediately after taking it out of the box, two buttons didn't work. Okay, let's look pass that, I don't see myself  using those constantly. But, whenever I tried to zoom into an object -blurry. Completely blurry. I tried zooming slowly as well but to no avail, my pictures turned blurry. It's as if the slightest movement, your picture is ruined. When trying the easy auto focus and the auto focus, both led me to have pictures that were a grainy, similar to Samsung's S5  front camera. My dog was my first test subject, he was completely still leaning against the sofa. only about 2 out of the 18 or so I took turned out clear quality, as others said. Taking pictures of other objects while the camera is on a flat surface didn't help either. More than that though.... the recording skips, screen goes black every couple seconds, and restarts the recording. Not touching any buttons and watching one for the recordings, the screen constantly went into recording mode.  Even when trying to take a picture again, no buttons pressed, the camera will begin to record. I did purchase a SD card so memory wasn't an issue here. I had various videos in 1-14 seconds long. I did get a good laugh though when my tech savvy sibling checked out the camera. He was trying to take a photo but the camera went into record mode. Now I have a 15 second video of the floor, hearing clicks from him pressing buttons, and commenting &#34;What? Is it recording?? Why won't it go the camera mode... These buttons don't work, no this needs to be returned. The heck.&#34; Probably if I had purchased a brand new one, my experience might've been different.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,1

Amazon Customer,5,"Great Camera, Great Price!",2015-02-24,Y,"Having only just received it yesterday in the mail, I don't have too much to review, but I have loved it so far! I have been messing around with all of the scene settings (there are so many!) and trying out the Easy Auto mode. Flash is super bright, but does not wash things out if it is actually needed. Quality of pictures is crisp and clear. Really looking forward to bringing this to Europe in May! I did notice that it is kind of hard to focus in the non-Auto modes. As an example (and not something I actually intend to use this camera for), I tried taking a picture of a photo I have in my house. On multiple settings, the screen would appear focused but as soon as I took the picture, it came out blurry. I'm not super concerned, because I will probably be letting the camera do all the work most of the time!",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,1

Uma,1,Turn it off and the lens retracts and turn it on and it works fine. This happened several times,2015-02-03,Y,"This review is from: Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Zoom Lens and Full HD 1080p Video (Black) (OLD MODEL) (Electronics)<br /><br />I bought this camera and the specified memory card and batteries to ensure I was using all the right equipment. I noticed the camera indicates lens error is you turn it on with the lens cap in place. No big deal, turn it off and take the camera cap off and turn it back on. Then I would randomly get the lens error issue while using the camera. Turn it off and the lens retracts and turn it on and it works fine. This happened several times, until one time the turning it off didn't help. I took out the batteries, the memory card. Put them back in and tried to turn it on. The lens still wouldn't retract. I did this for several days and nothing worked. Finally I called Amazon. They said call Nikon because it's under warranty. I called nikon, the said send it to a service center, I also told them that I recently noticed that the metal on the battery door was eroding. But the lens issue, is what is keeping me from using using the camera. They noted all of that and sent me a link to complete a service request. I did everything I was told and sent the camera for Precision Camera for repair. One week, went by no contact from precision camera. I tried calling them couldn't get a person on the phone. I tried again the next week, after being on hold for a while I pressed random numbers and go through to a person. I let her know that I had sent my camera in and that I wanted to know if it had been received and the status of the repair. She said yeah we have it, it's not been repaired because it out of warranty. I told I called Nikon and the said it was not and to send it in. I then had to provide her the Nikon incident number so she could contact them to see if Nikon would pay for the repair. I asked her why no one called to let me know they had my camera and were not working on it for 2 weeks. She said &#34;I don't know, but allthat matters is going forward.&#34; ...... Then she said she would call back and let me know what Nikon said. 10 days go by and the Postman delivers my camera unrepaired. I called Precision Camera and asked why the sent it back without fixing it, the said it failed a pressure test and would not be repaired because of the battery door eroding. And that it would cost too much to repair. I told her I don't care about the battery door, it's the lens error that keeping the camera from working. She said contact Nikon....... A total of 2 months later, Nikon said sorry it's too much to repair. It would be cheaper for YOU to buy a new camera! This is absurd. Because other that the lens issue and battery door (inside) the camera is in like new condition! I will never buy Nikon, again.",2,1,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,4

But I didn't find the focusing powers to be what I imagined. The fine focus on close up objects is lacking, as is the high power zoom. You get what you pay for right? This is a great deal, but ask yourself, &#34;Why is this such a great deal?&#34;. It's because it's just an average camera. If you're looking for something a little bit higher end for a hobbyist photographer, I would recommend you go for something else.

Roy,4,"I started looking at ""super-zoom"" cameras as an option and I'm so glad I did",2014-07-25,N,"I bought this camera to replace my aging Panasonic Lumix LZ-7 that did well for 7 years, but it was time for an upgrade. With the advancement of smartphone cameras I knew I wanted something that would last me for a while and offered something a smartphone couldn't. I started looking into older DSLRs and mirrorless system cameras from Nikon, Canon, and Samsung but I couldn't justify paying $400+ for the camera body and additional lenses when I would only be using it occasionally. I started looking at &#34;super-zoom&#34; cameras as an option and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />The pictures are phenomenal in good light and decent in low light situations. The zoom is amazing, but if you use the zoom in low light, expect your pictures to not look so great. It's the nature of the beast; even though it looks like a mini dSLR this camera is still a point-&-shoot camera with point-&-shoot limitations. Picture quality will not be that of a dSLR. You can't get the same manual control that you would on a dSLR or mirrorless control. If you're looking for that you know you'll have to pay more. For those who aren't that interested in f/stops or aperture settings and want the camera to take a great picture this is the camera for you.<br /><br />My plan for this camera is to use it when traveling so it would be great for museums, buildings, posed shots, etc. It may have trouble keeping up with things like rodeos and motocross events, but you can't argue with a camera for less than $200 with a long zoom lens. My personal preference is that my camera use AAs; I have a rechargeable set that I take and if SHTF I can always run into a convenience store worldwide and pick up an alkaline set for my camera. Plus there's no need for a separate/proprietary charging cord to forget.<br /><br />Are there better cameras out there? Yes.<br />Are there cheaper cameras out there? Absolutely<br />You have to look at the balance of price/quality/feature set that are offered on all cameras. No camera will hit every requirement you may need. This one hit a lot of mine and I'm very happy. Maybe by the time I have kids years from now I'll be ready for a dSLR or mirrorless, but for now this will do fine.",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,5

It ended up breaking because the camera can turn on in a bag and the lens wants to go out once it's on, and with the lens cap on everything gets jammed up and stopped working. So I bought this one, being optimistic that it would take as nice pictures as my original, older model. Unfortunately, a lot of the pictures came out blurry (I literally sat the camera on the floor and took a picture to check if it was me- it wasn't) and the color was weird no matter what setting I put it on.

md hasnain,3,"Decent pics, moody flash",2014-06-30,N,"I bought this after my Panasonic point-and-shoot died of acute sand poisoning - a pretty common ailment among digital cameras I believe. I did more research before buying this sucker than I did for my Master's thesis 10 years ago, and decided on this cute little not-quite-a-pocket-camera-not-quite-a-dslr. It is rather adorable, but right out of the box, I was concerned. The first night I had it, I could NOT get the flash to work. I read the manual, tried different modes, manually popped up the flash - nothing! Grrr, I thought. Well, luckily my brother's wedding (which I mostly bought it for in the first place) is outside and during the day - so off I trot to sunny CA to be the good sister. Over the course of the next week, results were mixed. The pictures that were good, were quite nice. The video I took of the wedding was okay. The sound capture was pretty disappointing, but I guess you can't expect much without an external mike. But still, the flash thing is driving me nuts! I've gotten it to work a few times so I know it's not the flash itself that's physically broken (maybe a sensor), but I also have a ton of test pictures that are dark and blurry because the flash refused to work - even on full auto mode, which is supposed to be idiot-proof. But maybe my idiocy can defy even it! Or maybe I just got a lemon. Part of my decision to write this review is in the hopes someone will comment and say, &#34;Well duh! You just have to ..........&#34; So, if, indeed, I'm missing something painfully obvious regarding the flash, please, let me know and I will duly accept my idiot-of-the-year award and continue to enjoy the camera.

Dharmesh tarapara.,5,Point and shoot fast with good quality lens.,2014-06-21,N,"I have been looking for a better quality point and shoot camera for my birthday last year to replace/supplement my Canon A1100 IS. What bothers me the most in these small lens, under powered cameras (just 2 AA batteries, not good enough for recharging flash in a reasonable time) is that they are slow. Most of the moments you want to capture, especially in low light, you are going to miss. I am not a photographer, not even an amateur one. I use camera to record events, rarely to capture an artistic image. Everybody knows how hard it is to capture the image of children on the move, surprising moments or animals.<br />I got this camera in red color in a local Target store. This camera does the job well. Somebody else reviewed this camera as &#34;point and shoot with lens on steroids&#34;. I fully agree. Thanks to the wide lens, good sensor, power coming from 4 standard AA batteries and paired with SDHC class 4 memory card, this camera is fast to take pictures (almost comparable to SDLR), even with the flash on and a good quality too (this is of course my non-educated opinion purely based on my sense of aesthetics). I also like the fact that the flash light is manually opened and closed, so it does not have to be switched off electronically by accessing some menu in firmware - fast and effective. If flash light gets in the way, just close it. The camera deals with low light conditions really well without the flash on.<br />I forgot to mention that it also shoots HD videos. I would recommend this camera to anybody that is an amateur family journalist to capture the moments in time without thinking much about setup and lighting conditions and other such parameters. Batteries last for quite long, however I did not measure this exactly. They definitely last longer than in my Canon, although it takes 2 times the amount of batteries to power this Nikon. It will also work with rechargeable (I use 4 Rayovac 1.2V NiMh).",3,3,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,3

Raj,5,On The Nikon L820 Camera-Great Purchase,2014-05-26,Y,"This camera is a pleasure to use.  It is intuitive and well laid out.  It's purpose is to be an automatic camera that takes great photos quickly and easily, in most situations.<br /><br />It's not for professional photographers by any means, but as a practical tool for general business and life, and for taking excellent photos quickly - it is unbeatable in this price range, as of this writing.  The 30x optical zoom is definitely cool and useful (yes, there are cameras with more zoom but this is plenty for many situations).  The lens can focus extremely close on zoom even from a working space distance away from the object (there are settings to monitor this on the view screen-see Using Macro Mode in manual).  I love this camera's ability to take close ups - close enough for most needs, after all, it's not a microscope.<br /><br />The lens movement is smooth (motor action) and has a great quality feel (all focusing is automatic; there is no manual focusing).  The auto focus is fast and sure.  Pictures snap quickly.  This camera has several continuous multi-shot shooting settings.  The L820 has plenty of scene shooting modes (e.g. night portrait, night landscape, snow) that are selected through the on-screen menu (not a touch screen menu).  The macro mode can be activated through a dedicated button that takes you to an On-Off screen that you have to select (by button presses) to enter the macro mode.  Again, the camera is intuitive, though reading the manual definitely helps to learn the camera's operation, the extent of options, and the limitations (such as which functions cannot be used simultaneously).<br /><br />This 16MP camera takes excellent photos; clear, sharp, and with good color.  I have absolutely no complaints about the picture quality.  (Note:  I don't have any complaints about this camera at all.)<br /><br />The thing I like most about the camera is the view screen; a small clear TV screen with plenty of on-screen data.  High sunlight does wash out the image so there are times you may have to cover the screen with your hand.  However, I should also note that I find this camera very easy to handle and manipulate.  It is comfortable.  (I use a small binder clip to help keep the lens cap attached to the camera strap and out of the way of the lens when taking pictures.)  One more thing about this TV screen: it does not articulate - it's a flat screen and does not open to give you flexibility in easy viewing when the positioning of the camera (to get the shot) is contorting or won't allow for direct visual contact (such as when holding the camera above your head with arm extended, in a crowd).  Personally, I can live with that, or rather, without it.<br /><br />Other points: At first glance, this camera has that Nikon professional look (like yeah, I watch NCIS - and those of you who watch also, know what I mean).  The L820 has the same Nikon QUALITY.  But, save for some shooting options, it is automatic and does not provide much in manual settings.  I say 'so what.'  The automatic focusing is extremely good, if not excellent.  Photos are spectacular for most people's needs.  And I would ask, 'exactly how much better can one do, in making the perfect setting, than this camera can do in capturing most, if not all, photos that a non-professional photographer would take.  If you want more, pay more.<br /><br />Lastly, I still want to have a smaller point & shoot camera that will fit into my pocket for reasons of portability and convenience.  This Nikon camera does not do that - It's too bulky for a pants pocket and I am sure too much mass for purses.<br /><br />But, for basic business, home, and general use, and ...<br /><br />to enjoy a great camera without too many confusing, time-consuming, or 'makes-no-difference' fine-tuning options, and ...<br /><br />to satisfy that NCIS desire to have a professional-looking Nikon (without paying the price), even if only for a fleeting peek and approval by casual onlookers,<br /><br/>then this camera is a no-regrets buy.",2,1,Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom,6

I put the pictures and videos from the camera on the 1080I HDTV and they looked and sounded awesome. My friend's $1500 Canon had some auto focus error and he asked me for my pics and he thought they were perfect. Also, if I bust this one I'm not out a fortune.

My only, and sincere complaint, is the SD card slot. It's in the battery compartment. It's aggravating because the batteries must be pressed down and the door of the compartment slid shut. You are probably thinking, how can that be a big thing? Which is exactly what I thought when reading other reviews before buying. Believe me, it does get on your nerves. It's a poorly designed feature. Depending on how often you insert or remove the SD card, it is a big deal.

Right now, the GPS info is recorded as part of the picture's file properties.

Jinendra jain,4,Easy for beginners,2015-02-03,N,"I didn’t purchase this camera from Amazon, but wanted to review it for other people- I have had this camera for over a year now. It’s great for wide angle shots and comes with some excellent features. One of my favourites is selective color which allows you to choose just one color- saves on all the photoshop editing time.<br />Some cons about this camera is the overheating- my camera is quick to overheat and will need some time to cool down. Maybe this is just a fault in my camera as I haven’t really heard anyone mention it otherwise.<br /><br />However, if you’re looking to getting into photography and don’t want to splurge in a DSLR then I would highly recommend this camera- easy to use and you get some great pictures too.",2,2,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,5

Taking pictures with it is a different story. Depending on the amount of zoom that you are using the quality of the picture will vary.  The images are soft when using the zoom taking still images.  This is not case when using the video, I have had the zoom at its full 42x and the video comes out great.  Used this to record Eagles at their nest and it was like I was up in the nest with them.  The mic was also able to pick sounds that I did not expect it to be capable of.  If Nikon comes out with a new camera with the same or better zoom capabilities that solves the softness problem I will defiantly be buying another camera from Nikon. Until then I am happy with this one and my many other Nikon DSLR cameras.  Having a hot shoe to add a shotgun mic or any other accessories would make this camera even better!",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,2

Anu,3,Beware of some Nikon CoolPix models !,2015-01-05,N,"My P520 has suffered from an early age from failing to turn on.  Some days it was OK, others it was DOA.  Googling it, this seems to be a common problem with a number of Coolpix moels. They issued a firmware update that addresses, mainly, power problems.  I set up the SD card to do the update, but, of course, you can't do it unless you can get the camera to wake up.  This went on unsuccessfully for a week, and I was ready to trash the camera.  Then this morning I pushed the Power Button and, voila, it started up. I immediately loaded the new firmware, and, so far, it has been behaving.  If I didn't already own this camera, I'd steer clear.  Update, a week later . . . P520 camera is behaving so far.  Even went so far as to buy a spare battery and charger.

smaranika,5,Amazing performance - comparable to DSLR without the huge price tag,2014-11-24,Y,"I purchased this camera about a month ago to replace my old Canon and have been extremely pleased! This camera has a wide variety of setting and configurations to fix majority of your needs. I am not in business as a full time photographer, but do it as a side job (weddings, newborns, birthdays, family photos, portraits, etc.) I've used this camera to do newborn photos, sporting events and an outdoor maternity shoot so far and it has performed like a champ. The image stabilizer helps to negate any camera shake while holding it in your hands while shooting. There are multiple different settings that allow you to change the exposure, aperture, shutter speed, and flash. There are a ton of preset Scenes that allow for quick changes in shooting modes without have to reset all of your desired settings. There is also a User mode that you can save any manually set configurations for easy use later on. I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone who is serious about photography and who doesn't have $600 to drop on a DSLR. This one performs at a better level than my old DSLR and cost about 75% less! My only issue so far is the with shooting Sports mode. You have the option of taking multiple shots (up to 7) in a row with one release of the shutter, but the camera takes a but to process them. This got on my nerves and I'm sure anyone who's ever shot a sporting event knows that the quicker your images save the quicker you can capture the next one. It probably best to use the Sports setting with a single shot sequence instead of doing multiples if you're working with quick moving subjects. Otherwise this camera meets all of my needs and can keep up with my various projects.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,5

Amazon Customer,2,This camera is not that good.......period,2014-11-21,Y,"I have had a few digital cameras with large optical zooms on them & recently purchased a Nikon P-520 digital camera here to replace a recently dead Nikon P-510 digital camera. Basically, both of these cameras are nearly the same. The only differences I have noticed is 2 more megapixels & a flip-out/swivel rear LCD view finder on the P-520 compared to a tilt-out rear LCD viewfinder on the P-510. I got many extremely great photos with my Nikon P-510 camera.....so far, the photo qualities with the P-520 seems identical to the P-510....considering it should since the lens & zoom are identical. This camera is easy to use, menu system is okay & identical to the P-510, good hand grip which is rubberized.....just like the prior P-510 camera.<br />Photo quality is rather good.....so far. I have taken just a few indoor and a handful of outdoor photos & photo quality seems just as good as the P-510 was....which is a good thing. Video quality is fine.<br />This camera comes in several different colors. I just get the black one because sometimes the price is a little lower compared to the colored versions of this camera. Not sure why Nikon does that since it is the same camera with a different colored plastic casing on it. Needless to say, this camera looks great.....typical Nikon quality as usual carries over to this camera too.<br /><br />Good points: 42X optical zoom, easy to use, easy to use menu system, good photo quality, decent video quality, takes SD cards, great rubberized hand grip, dual zoom levers, decent battery life and very little shutter lag.<br />Bad points: This camera has issues starting up sometimes, the zoom sometimes does not zoom out when you activate the lever[s], I have had battery issues and I have had issues of the camera turning off on its own with no warning. I have sold the camera to somebody else. I purchased a Canon digital camera to replace this troublesome Nikon.<br />Update: Photo quality is acceptable, video quality is acceptable and battery life is fine for this camera....when it's working. I have had a lot of power issues with this camera in the past 3 weeks and far more troublesome than older Nikon P510 digital cameras I had before.<br />I gave this camera at least 2 months and it basically did not do as well of a job overall than the prior Nikon P-510 and therefore I got rid of it and got a newer Canon digital camera to replace it.

Anu,5,Just fantastic!,2014-08-30,N,"The manual is daunting, but in reality, it works about the same as any other compact camera, except that for advanced photographers it has a lot of options. The telephoto lens is unbelievable; it is rare for a picture to be out of focus at any distance.  If you remember to flip up the flash, the camera figures out  if it is needed.  The pix of a vacation were about 98% keepers. The built-in choice to color-correct the original pictures shows you both corrected and uncorrected so you can pick best. I don't know how it adjusts shutter speed for sharp-focus pix of moving subjects, but it does. The only criticisms are (a) the lens cover is sort of cheesy, can only be properly attached when camera is turned off, pops off and falls on ground if put on while lens is extended and retracts when camera turned ; (b) when you correct a pic, a new corrected pic goes to the end of the slide show, and you have to delete the uncorrected one and then fiddle around to get the corrected one back in order; and not all photo suites will work with Nikon.  However, their tech support is first-rate. On balance, a great camera for a talented amateur photographer.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,3

palraj,2,Lens Error,2014-06-10,N,"When I first received this for Christmas my initial response was pleasure.<br /><br />I have owned a Coolpix previously and it worked like a charm for the price.<br /><br />This camera is unfortunately a cheaply made blunderbuss in the age of automatic rifles.<br /><br />1. Remember those old cameras which took 10 seconds to charge the flash in between<br />pictures?  This isn't one of them, but it does take about 6-8 seconds to manage a halfway<br />decent auto-focus.  In dim light it is even worse.  The results were also so-so.<br /><br />2. I used this camera for two months before receiving the LENS ERROR of death.  At most<br />I had taken 25-30 pictures.  Just one day I picked it up and beep.  Nothing but that screen.<br />I couldn't even take the pictures off the cameras internal memory. I hadn't even bothered<br />to format the sd card I had, so...that was a bit frustrating.<br /><br />3. I received this for Christmas and my wife had purchased it in October.  No chance of direct<br />return to Amazon.  Buyer beware.<br /><br />4. I tried to contact Nikon but it was a constant hassle.  Eventually they wanted to precharge<br />my credit card $137 in order for me to spend the $30 bucks to insure ship the camera.<br /><br />5. So Screw Them.  I want a DSLR anyway.  I did take the thing apart eventually and the insides<br />are...ugh.  You don't want to know.

When the camera arrived it was packaged in a generic white box with a poor quality lazer printed label glued to the box that depicted the camera and some Nikon graphics.  The only reason to not include the factory box is because the item is either counterfeit or refurbished.  I sent them EPICDEALS an e-mail and this is the response:<br /><br />&#34;we sell new camera in bulk pack that's way they are in whit box and how we can sell them ata lower price if you do not like it and want to send it back we can send you out a USPS lable and we will pay to get the camera back but the camera in new in white box thats how we can get it at a lower price and please let us know what you wold like us to do to keep you happy with us&#34;<br /><br />Obviously, not a reputable dealer.

Amazon Customer,5,Best point n shoot wildlife camera ever,2014-05-11,Y,"I read a lot if reviews before purchasing this. I have had a Nikon coolpix for the past 3 years. Prior to that I owned a similar Olympus but Olympus quit putting in a eye view finder and I photograph birds and other fast moving objects so that is a must. I need a camera that I can just grab and go so it cannot weigh much, plus I tend to drop it bang cameras a lot so can't really validate purchasing an slr. Essentially I needed a camera that had a very wide range of focal lengths, decent resolution and did not take several paychecks to purchase. So to all those who whine and complain about the camera..... Sure it's not as good as a 15000 slr w a 800mm lense, that you can then switch to a 29mm lense when you want a scenic view, but common this costs 350.  If you don't believe me, the pics on the link below were take about 15-20 yards away- you can see the dried salt on the terns nostrils- that's good enough for me.

No interchangeable lenses to haul around or fiddle with. Up to 16 megapixel lets you do some serious cropping and still get nice clear prints even at 8x10. Ability to switch from screen to view finder is a plus in real bright light, but the screen still lets you see enough detail to frame things up in fairly bright light. Get extra batteries if you are a serious amateur shutterbug, especially in cold weather. But that's true for any rechargeable lithium system. I keep 5 charged batteries with me when on vacation.

krishna,3,Dealbreaker EVF,2014-02-25,N,"You can tell that Nikon is really trying these days.  Back in the mid-2000's when the Digital Rebel was kicking up it's heels it seems Nikon had no clue on how to compete in the lower end of the digital market.  Today things are different.  I had a few Panansonic FZ cameras but abandoned them when the UI was getting long in the tooth and Panasonic was distracted.  I've since moved onto M 4/3 cameras and am generally happy.  Except when I need some lens reach.<br /><br />So I'm shopping around again.  I think Nikon is really trying in this compact segment of the market.  The P510 had alot going for it.  (The P510 was the breakthrough camera.  The P520 is more treading water and has some issues that make the P520 a misstep (battery life, focus hunting for most of the long range, etc.)  So my experience is one of shopping for a travel zoom and I've been doing a lot of research and putting hands on these cameras before purchase.  The IQ of the P510/P520 is really good for the compact segment.  The body design overall is nice.  The menu system is adequate.  However, personally, I really like the experience of a viewfinder.  A viewfinder really can put you into the scene and really concentrate on composition.  It is quite important.<br /><br />The problem is that the viewfinder on the P510/P520 is tiny.  I could not believe how small it was.  I felt like I was looking through the window of a very small fairy house.  It is not a usable viewfinder.  In fact it's almost like not having a viewfinder at all.  Note to camera makers:  *** 201,000 dot EVF is a joke *** .<br /><br />I don't know if Canon and Nikon and the rest realized this.  But the market is ripe for a small camera with a good sized viewfinder for $300 price point.  The Canon SX500/510 is a terrific sized small camera.  If you put a solid EVF on that kind of platform sales would go through the roof.  Stop playing the megapixel wars (this is happening now with settling back to 12-16 MP), stop the hyper zoom wars (50x is just silly), settle on quality, not just specs, and put a blessed viewfinder that is really good (1,440,000-dot) on a small body of decent zoom (max 24x to 30x) and watch a stellar hit in the making.<br /><br />I've decided to get a [[ASIN:B00ATM1MGA Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black)]] to quench my long lens urges.(50x is just silly), settle on quality, not just specs, and put a blessed viewfinder that is really good (1,440,000-dot) on a small body of decent zoom (max 24x to 30x) and watch a stellar hit in the making.<br /><br />I've decided to get a [[ASIN:B00ATM1MGA Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD (Black)]] to quench my long lens urges.",4,3,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,4

Vineeth,3,"Beautiful Pictures, Great Low Light but Slow and Freezes Sometimes",2014-02-09,N,"I like taking pictures but am no expert.  I am still debating whether to keep this camera.

I know I should not expecting miracle with a bridge camera but I have missed some nice shots.  My old Canon S3 (which is quite a few years old) does not seem to be much slower.  Worse - sometimes nothing happens when I push the shutter button on the P520 - it seems to be hung up on focusing or something.<br /><br />The bright side is the pictures are beautiful.  I am especially impressed by the low-light performance.  Battery life is OK - I have the GPS turned off and use the viewfinder.<br /><br />I did have 2 or 3 freezes in the last 2 weeks.  Basically, the camera became unresponsive to anything.  I had to pull the battery out to reset it.  I don't feel it is a hardware problem - it seems like a software timing thing.  Once it was in the middle of shooting a video (and the memory card was still pretty empty).  It seems others have reported this too.

It allows me to capture the craters on the moon and with the macro setting turned on, to get detailed rain drops hanging off leaves.  The shutter speed is also great – ranging from 1 to one four-thousandths of a second.  There are no stock lens filters available for this camera which was disappointing because I wanted to fit it with a UV filter to protect the lens.  Also the aperture limited to F:3 TO F:8.4 which doesn’t give the same control of depth of focus as I had wanted.

Sujatha,4,A good upgrade to the Nikon Coolpix S9100!,2014-02-02,N,"I got this camera shortly after Thanksgiving 2013 after deciding that I wanted to further increase my skill set in photography. After I pretty much drove my Kodak EasyShare M893 into the ground over three years of use (June 2008-July 2011) and 10,000+ pictures, I got the Nikon Coolpix S9100 in September 2011. Although I still use the S9100 as my general-use camera having taken more than 4,500 pictures since purchasing it, the P520 has now become the third camera I've owned since 2008. It's a well-built, high quality camera with a lot of good features that will produce some stunning pictures under the correct conditions. I have yet to test it to its full extent since at the time of writing this review it's really cold here in southern Minnesota, and I don't dare expose this thing to temperatures of -15!<br /><br />Some positives about the P520:<br />* Indoor pictures turn out great, but you need to know when to use the flash, and when you can compensate using exposure compensation. As an example, I took a really good shot of my family over the Christmas holiday, and although it was slightly overexposed, the lighting conditions inside the residence where the picture was shot was actually relatively dark. Flash and the AF assist light on the front of the camera were important for allowing the shot to come out correctly. During the day, if you're planning to shoot indoors, use the Best Shot Selector (BSS) continuous shooting capability to get the most crisp shots you can.<br /><br />* The number of different image resolutions is excellent for being able to take shots with many different aspect ratios (4:3, 16:9, 3:2, 1:1, etc). Overall, the camera's image resolutions tend to favor 4:3 ratios (for standard-resolution monitors), but I still have two options for taking pictures that will fit my 16:9 widescreen monitor at home perfectly (1920x1080 @ 2MP or 4864x2736 @ 13MP).<br /><br />* Really like to have the power to experiment with aperture priority, shutter priority, and program modes. For an amateur photographer like myself who likes to snap a lot of pictures on campouts with the Boy Scout troop I'm in, this is really a good way to see what settings work best when conditions change frequently.<br /><br />* The way that you can hold the camera just like a regular DSLR is awesome! It's just one way to add to the experience of owning this piece of machinery.<br /><br />* Having the LCD screen tilt and rotate is nice when you need to get the camera into an awkward position or other location where taking a picture would otherwise be inconvenient. You can definitely take some good selfies with this camera! I haven't used the viewfinder enough to know if it's of any practical use since the regular LCD screen is of such high quality (921K dots), but I can say that it's hard to look through it since it really forces me to squint out of one eye pretty tightly. It's uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />Some negatives about the P520:<br />* Would like to see some improvements to the menu system. I think that the reactivity to selecting menu options is nice with the command dial, but using the multi selector dial to select options seems to be a little slower compared to how my S9100 would be able to just breeze through them all.<br /><br />* Yes, the auto focus issue is certainly something worth mentioning here, but that's just something I've learned to deal with even on my S9100. I'm used to it being slow sometimes.<br /><br />* The Nikon-branded case that comes with this camera (if you purchase this as a \\""kit\\"" instead of just the boxed package) is indeed too small. You won't be able to fit the camera in there unless you cram it. The strap just ends up making an already tight fit worse. As mentioned in the \\""Photographer's Guide to the Nikon Coolpix P520\\"" book (which I also highly recommend purchasing), you can get the Lowepro Rezo 100 AW camera bag, and this will come with a rain shield which can be draped over the inside of the bag to provide better protection from the elements when necessary.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />* Some reviews state that you absolutely have to take the lens cap off before powering on the camera to prevent the lens zoom motors from grinding and generating an error. This is not true -- if you turn on the camera accidentally without remembering to take off the lens cap, it does nothing to hurt the camera in any way since the lens cap would be attached to the lens and not the body. But you will see a very black-colored display if you do end up forgetting to take it off!<br /><br />* Be sure to buy an external EN-EL5 battery charger and spare batteries for this camera. As you normally have to leave the battery in the camera to charge it, I don't know if I would trust leaving a camera as expensive as this unattended (for me at summer camp, this is a high possibility, so the purchase of an external charger was an absolute must).<br /><br />Considering all of these points, my final verdict has to be that this camera has very good potential for becoming the best camera I've owned yet, but I have to test it further to try out all of its built-in features. I'll be updating this post as I find out new things about it.",3,3,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,4
Guru macharla,5,Everyone's Camera,2014-01-30,Y,From the days of my Argus C-3 years ago I have enjoyed taking photos of my travels and now my family.  I welcomed the  change from Kodak film to digital photography - what an incredible change.  For a few years I enjoyed using a basic Canon point and shoot and it served me well.

faizman Ali khan,1,Do yourself a favor and try a different camera,2014-01-29,Y,"I picked up this camera as a Christmas gift for my wife.  The first few shots out of the box were great - mostly stills, between 3 and 15 feet away, indoors with ideal lighting.  If that's the kind of photography you're planning on doing, this is your camera.  Outdoor shots, less than ideal lighting, or anything requiring even minimal zoom were basically worthless.  This camera will not focus in dim or dark lighting, and will not focus when zoomed.  We even tried a tripod, but it just couldn't handle it.  Kind of a shame - the zoom lens on this camera is pretty impressive, but the software just isn't up for the job.  My iPhone camera blows away the P520 in most situations.  We gave this thing an honest try for about 3 weeks, then ordered a Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200.  The plan was to do a side-by-side comparison of the two and return the lesser camera.  The Lumix blew away the Coolpix in every single area.  Crisp, clear shots day or night, zoomed or close up, handheld or tripod.  Needless to say the Coolpix P520 was returned a week or so after we got the Lumix.  This camera WILL disappoint you - I definitely would not recommend it.",4,3,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,1
yuvaraj,5,"Impressive zoom capabilities, Compact package",2014-01-27,Y,"So my wife told me a few weeks back she wanted to get a more real camera. Neither of us is a photographer, we have no real interest in photography. She wanted it so she can take pictures of the kid, and the pets, and our activities in higher quality and resolution than her cell phone or our cheap point and shoot cameras could offer. More to the point, when she has them printed out professionally, she wants them to look nice -not pixely or distorted.<br /><br />THE SEARCH BEGINS<br />So costco has the nikon DSLR's. I have a photographer friend who bought one and has had good results using it and says it's a real good value. It's also $1000. That's a bit excessive for us, as we wouldn't know where to even begin with such a camera. There's also higher-end point and shoot cameras, which are probably pretty good as the MP's of them have really risen in the past few years. However, the problem is they don't zoom, or don't zoom very far. And once you use the digital zoom feature, your resolution goes downhill in a hurry and you generally lose image stabilization, so taking a non-blurry picture becomes nigh-impossible.<br /><br />Actually didn't know about this line of cameras at all. I typed in &#34;digital camera&#34; into amazon's search engine and started browsing. Didn't get very far, so I decided I'd look at nikon's offerings as I owned a higher end film nikon back in the day and my friend uses nikon exclusively. This camera's lower end version was on the first page of &#34;nikon digital camera&#34;, and after looking at the different options I settled for this one.<br /><br />THE CAMERA:<br />The device itself is impressive. It's not as big as a DSLR, most notably it doesn't have a giant honking disconnectable lens hanging off the front of it. What is present is the HUGE built in auto-zoom lens, the flip around screen, and the selector wheel. I love that the wheel is made of actual steel (or I presume steel) and the edges are coarse so it's easy to use in your fingers. Each selection has a very positive detente, so there's no question about what setting it's on and it definitely does NOT feel cheap. The flip around screen is large and has good resolution. I'm not really sure why it flips around, and if I ever find a use for that feature I'll update this review. The body is weighty, but not super heavy and feels good in your hands and overall has a real good look to it.<br /><br />THE ZOOM:<br />It has a little selector on the lens body which puts it into manual mode which is a real nice feature. I've yet to use it, but if I was more of a pro photographer I could see needing it for faster action shots at a distance. The zoom on this camera is impressive. I'm so glad I purchased the higher end version with the big zoom as you can really take distance pictures easily.<br /><br />THE VIDEO:<br />It really amazes me that I can own a device for a reasonable sum of money which takes this good of video and pictures at the same time. The video is great, there's no other way to put it. I don't feel like I've settled for a combo device which does nothing well. This camera seems to do it all well. The audio isn't the best-best, but it's infinitely better than a cell phone video which is all we require from it.<br /><br />THE FEATURES:<br />Read the manual, it has them in spades. Honestly, I've yet to use even half of them. But for taking quality pictures and videos, and a great zoom feature this camera seems to do no wrong. Also, it's worth mentioning that you can't use filters with this camera as it's presently configured. However the lens is somewhat threaded and they sell adapters that allow you to use filters. Honestly, I don't have any expertise in that department so I don't know if I'll ever do that.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />This camera is more than enough for your average picture taker. My friend toyed around with it for a bit, and his thoughts were that if I ever get bored with this camera a proper DSLR will be the next step, but for my uses it's so far beyond adequate it's unlikely. I'm very pleased with this purchase and so far have not had any issues with it's usage.",6,6,Nikon COOLPIX P520 18.1 MP Digital Camera with 42x Zoom,2

Would have rated it a 5, except I've had very poor experience with Nikon customer service. The photo software that came with the camera has never worked. I contacted Nikon on 3 different occasions to try and resolve issue. They insisted there is a problem with my computer...well why does my Kodak software work perfectly fine with the Nikon camera? There is a definite problem with the Nikon NX2 software, but rather than work with me try to fix the problem, customer service found it easier to blame my computer, and called it a day.

Cannot see viewfinder underwater, so I did point and click somewhat randomly, but photos were good.  Main complaint is that I was not certain the photo was being taken underwater, because the shutter is a little hard to push.  Cannot tell if you really clicked the shot or not, so sometimes I missed some great photo opportunities.  Sometimes I also took movie instead of stills by accident too.  Probably with practice you could learn how to minimize the errors, but be aware of that if you are using it for the first time.  It really does stay dry inside!",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX S32,1

It was out of warranty so Nikon refused to do anything even though we had used it 3 times total including the trip where it leaked.  Well it was more than bad luck.  The 32 did the same thing on the first use in the ocean although it didn't leak as badly since it just fogged up the lens.

So, I am going to buy another Nikon ??S32. I will have 4 batteries. I see it is discontinued. It is easy to work in the water. crystal sharp pictures. I think the S33 is stereo. (keep it closed when around salt water). Use the strap / or loose it ! Back on the ship wash it, dry it, down load the pictures to a laptop, change the SD chip. NEVER keep all your photo on one chip. For the money it is the best water camera I have found. Take an extra battery and SD in two zip bags this will keep them dry. (Use them ONLY if necessary, change in a dry area). Take pictures of people in the water and give them copies, good way to make friends. Via, Email. NOTE. the S32 uses an EL-19 battery, not expensive. It does last quite a while. Good camera if not abused or opened need water. When buying a camera, NOTE the battery type. &#34;I'm sold on the S32&#34;",1,1,Nikon COOLPIX S32,3

We didn't have any problems with it at all and the battery lasted 2 days and wasn't even dead when we charged it. We went snorkeling and took a ton of pictures. I would highly recommend this camera. Some of the underwater video is a bit choppy and looks more like a slide show of pictures but the images are super clear, some of the videos are great though. The video may have been weird because it is very hard to hold still while floating in the ocean with the waves.

That was one of the main considerations when purchasing the camera. I bought this for my 7 year old who likes to take pictures and wanted to have a camera for the beach. However I wish there was an eye piece to look through.  When taking pictures outside it is often too bright to see what is on the lcd viewing screen, and without being able to look through an eyepiece you have to blindly shoot at your target. For that reason he never even brought it down to the beach and just left it in the hotel after the first day.  Indoors it works great and takes very nice pictures.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX S32,1

Rp,5,Totally Perfect!,2015-01-13,Y,"This camera - the blue Nikon CoolPix S32 - is just awesome!!<br /><br />First, let me say that we bought this for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas. She's been a little obsessed with taking pictures for years (oh yeah, years, like since she was about 2) and we had just let her have our old, beat up point and shoot. Naturally, she's gotten better as she's gotten older, but that camera had taken a beating and finally just couldn't snap a picture in under 37 seconds to save its life. Enter the begging for a new camera from Santa...<br /><br />After a lot of research - like throwing cameras in the store and talking to a bunch of manufacturer service people - we decided on this one. I will say that it helped it's blue since that is her favorite color... and the price was way better than the only other comparable camera that we found...<br /><br />So the camera arrived and we were totally blown away! After reading the reviews, we were pretty prepared for a kind of bulky feeling and looking thing, small but still a little awkward... It's so not like that. The lens does raise off of the &#34;body&#34; a little, but it's minimal. It's not going to be the smallest camera you've ever seen and it's not going to fit into your credit card slot of your wallet or something crazy... But it's a lot smaller and sleeker than many of the reviews let on. The buttons aren't ginormous, but they're not teeny tiny either. For a (below average size) 5 year old - they're just right and could probably even be a little bigger for a man's fingers.<br /><br />Fast forward to Christmas morning, a stunned 5 year old dancing with her new camera, and instantly dropping/throwing the camera in her excitement to use the camera to take a picture of every single thing... As parents, it's almost like slow motion watching the brand new camera fly through the air. Despite all our gasps and fears, the camera bounced off a table, a wall, the 5 year old, at least one sleeping Boxer, and the floor but still came away looking perfectly new and un-dropped. And the pictures definitely don't show any sort of drop or damage or hit...<br /><br />While we can't speak to the water aspect or the quality of pictures through/in water, I can't think of how to damage this camera... Just in the first day that she had it, our daughter swung it into about a dozen walls and hit just about every piece of furniture in two houses with it; a niece tried to go bowling with the camera across the kitchen floor... And the camera still looks brand new, acts like it's never taken a hit, and the pictures seem just as clear and crisp as any other point and shoot we've ever had. (Actually, this is better than anything we've ever had besides the DSLR.)<br /><br />If you're looking for a point-and-shoot, there's plenty of options out there. This one is going to last and it's going to be able to take a beating, all while matching up to a lot of those smaller cameras... For us, the S32 is just really the best option for something that'll be around and working for a long time to come!",3,2,Nikon COOLPIX S32,4

s k ghosh,3,good underwater and point n shoot but need to read manual,2015-01-04,N,"I had a panasonic that died a couple of years after purchase with water getting past the seal even though it was clean. I bought this to replace and was impressed by the increase in picture quality. It was doing great with some under water shots but one day the battery was flat so I dried the camera, shook it to make sure no water was trapped in the gaps and then opened the cover. After replacing the battery it failed and will now not turn on. I looked inside and found a drop of water had gotten by (salt water!) So its not possible to safely use a towel to dry and then change. you need to fresh water wash, tissue try and wait for the water trapped in the gaps to evaporate. I find that I use up a batterry in half a days travel photos so need a spare battery. Wish the bat compartment was more sealed so this didnt happen no water was on the batery contacts or sd card just on the inside edge of the door about half a drop. Funny thing is it still powers up when plugged in for charging, everything good, just wont turn on after unplugging I like the camera so will buy another and never open without dry as per manual. A few other things in the manual need to be read to prevent camera damage. When I bought it I used the same sd card in a good canon SLR and shot the same photo in each camera.

sonu,5,love my nikon coolpix s32,2014-11-08,Y,"This underwater camera is just awesome. Super easy to use, fun and best of all it's a Nikon so it will last forever. We bought this for our upcoming cruise. We have played with it in our pool to make sure we know how to use it. It takes great pictures, and there are different scenes that you can choose from.<br /><br />The pictures are really clear, and I love how light it is. I highly recommend this product. The disposable cameras are garbage, and run about $13, plus those disposable cameras are just junk.<br /><br />I am in love with my underwater Nikon coolpix S32. With 13.2 megapixels it will take great pictures underwater or dry land.<br /><br />Comes with everything you need, except a memory card. I recommend using a class 10 32 gig memory card it'll take a thousand plus pictures and you'll love every one of them great product would buy it again if something happened to this one.",6,3,Nikon COOLPIX S32,3

Ridhima sahay,2,Not good enough for everyday use. Buy only if waterproof camera is required.,2014-10-26,Y,"Bought the Coolpix S32 thinking it would replace my Sony CyberShot DSC-T100 pocket camera. Nothing wrong with old camera except battery life. Wanted a camera with a rechargable LiIon battery; which the S32 has. Battery life is great - just charged up after a few weeks of use. Down side - since I plugged it in to charge, I downloaded the pictures. They looked OK on the little camera screen. Not so good now on my computer. Photo quality is very grainy and blurred for the room lit shots without flash. Even outdoor in the sun shots are not that great. I thought the waterproof part would just be a bonus to a good camera but found that it is the only reason you should buy the camera. Use it on a canoe trip or snorkeling. Maybe an underwater pool pic??? But you will be disappointed with a wedding photo or kids playing in the yard or birthday party pics. The other caution I have is that the lens is not covered. The Sony had a slide cover that protected the lens when not in use. Nothing for this one. Looks like a clear plastic case lens over the touted &#34;glass nikkor&#34; lens. I don't think it will be long before it is scratched up. Beach sand sounds like a problem when it's time to wipe the water drops off the lens when transitioning between in and out of water photography.",4,2,Nikon COOLPIX S32,4

rajesh sharma,5,Great for kids,2014-10-20,N,"I bought this for my almost 3 year old daughter who loves taking pictures with our phones. I looked into a lot of options, but didn't want to buy a toy camera with crappy quality, so ended up looking at water/shockproof options. I was concerned that any non-toy camera might be too complicated, but took a chance. Of course my daughter can't yet really use any of the extra options, but the camera and buttons are sized well, so she is able to turn it on and off, and take pictures with no problems and she loves having her own camera. The shock and water proofing give me a bit of piece of mind -- though I also ended up buying a 2 year service plan for it just in case.",6,5,Nikon COOLPIX S32,3

I have kids, and liked the fact that this camera is waterproof and shock-resistant. I don't plan on taking many underwater photos; I just thought that extra guarantee would be nice.<br /><br />However, I find that the majority of photos I've taken in the last month are not usable. Indoor pictures are blurry and muddy or severely over-exposed due to a very bright flash. Even outdoors, the flash completely overwhelms the photos (in automatic mode). I tried the burst-mode (multiple shots in succession), but action shots were still blurry and badly lit.<br /><br />I know most cheap point-and-shoots won't take amazing photos every time, but I'm frustrated that I can't seem to take ANY photos that are worth looking at twice.<br /><br />Not a huge complaint, but I hadn't seen this in the description and thought it was notable: as far as I can tell, there is no zoom toggle on this camera, so for all photos you need to get closer/farther to the subject rather than staying in place and zooming. A minor inconvenience for me in general, but still notable.",5,3,Nikon COOLPIX S32,4

Amazon Customer,5,Great value underwater camera,2014-09-20,N,"This is a great camera.  I have seen so many mixed reviews about underwater cameras - the general consensus seems to be that they do not take as good pictures as a standard point-and-shoot camera.  With this in mind I was wary of spending hundreds of $$ on an underwater camera....<br />This Nikon seemed to fit the bill as it cost just over $100.  I rationalized that this would only be the cost of buying a few disposable cameras (after taking into account the cost of developing the film) and the pictures had to be better quality.<br /><br />I took this camera snorkeling and the pictures and videos were great quality (not SLR quality but this was nowhere near the cost of an SLR).  There are 2 big buttons on the top of the camera, one for taking pictures, the other for video - this made it easy to take pics/video when in the water (didn't have to switch to video mode or press a small record button on the back of the camera).<br /><br />This camera is geared towards children (big buttons and the screen visuals point to this) but it is great for those times you'll be around water.<br /><br />One annoyance is that the battery gets charged when in the camera (the charging socket is inside the camera housing) instead of having an external charger.  I guess this reduces the amount of equipment that you have to carry but I like being able to charge a spare battery when using the camera.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.",24,24,Nikon COOLPIX S32,5

aafy,3,better than a ziploc bag over your camera.,2014-08-02,Y,"The good is that this camera is easy to use, the waterproofness seems to be perfect, and it appears durable enough. The price is, of course, great. And as long as your expectations are tempered by what you just paid, you might be satisfied.<br /><br />The weakness is that the picture quality is &#34;meh&#34; at best. In particular, the camera struggles to focus, esp. in video mode. Worse, it doesn't seem to adjust focus while shooting video, so once you're shooting, you better hope the action doesn't shift.  Also, the zoom doesn't work in video mode (except the digital zoom, as I found out the hard way). Even in bright sunlight the still shots are mediocre, and the color seems weirdly vivid (although, to be fair, I should probably make sure it isn't set to some sort of filter). Again, the auto focus has issues, and is easily fooled, slow to set up, and just... mediocre. One other thing: Basically, this is a cheap digital camera in a shock/water proof plastic housing. Among other things, this means that the tripod mount is plastic, which worries me, as I use it a lot. I work very hard to not strip or worse, crack the mounting point.<br /><br />If you have an iPhone or other high end smart-phone, you might be far better served to get a really great case for that. I bought this for the beach and for shooting video of bike rides, but I wish I had just sprung for something better, like a go-pro for video, and a super-durable case for my smart phone.",8,5,Nikon COOLPIX S32,5

The factory unit will leave you hanging if you play with it plenty, like I did, and start taking lots of videos. Stand by time isn't too bad, but those videos and then doing play back, certainly suck the battery dry. I bough the Wasabi Power set and it's my perfect companion for it.<br /><br />If you don't get anything, the only way to charge the battery is in the camera. The battery robbed it of the extra star.<br /><br />Best value for you buck. Sometimes the colors on the LCD look a little wacky but on my computer they are great.

I have it and I love it.",5,1,Nikon COOLPIX S32,3

Supriya Kumari,1,Terrible camera--Don't Buy!!,2014-06-02,Y,"I purchased this camera on April 29th for a trip to the USVI for snorkeling.  It takes terrible (out of focus and blue) underwater pictures and showed \\""Memory Exhausted\\"" when only 10 pictures were taken on a 32GB memory card.  The throw-away plastic cameras take better underwater pictures than this camera!! I tried to return it but Amazon said I had to have sent it back by yesterday--June 1st.  I've owned a number of Nikon Cool Pix cameras and this one is not up to Nikon standards. Don't waste your money on it!!

Considering that this is camera designed to be used near and in the water the sound quality is unacceptable . Once the camera was wet and I took a video above the water the sound was completely muffled and unintelligible. What good is a 1080 HD video with terrible sound?

Amazon Customer,3,I would not buy this for anything other that taking photos in/near water or for kids.,2014-05-09,Y,"Received the camera today, bought for an upcoming vacation.<br /><br />Very simplistic camera as far as settings go.<br /><br />Choices for picture quality are Large (around 5 megabyte per image) Medium (around 900 Kilobytes per image) and Small (around 500 Kilobytes per image)<br /><br />Tested both pictures indoor and outdoor.<br /><br />I don't know the technical digital photography terms, but I think it's the ISO settings, whatever it is, this camera does not seem to do well with inside.  Using flash or not, regardless of image size there is allot of pixilation noise going on in the background of almost all images.  Macro shots barely acceptable in my opinion.  (even after choosing macro mode) Even with the large image setting, ANY zooming in on the picture will show much graininess.<br /><br />Outside not in direct sunlight the pictures seemed to be much better, none of that pixilation noise in the background, but again any zooming in on the picture looks like it's an 8-bit Nintendo game.<br /><br />The saving grace for this camera will be that it is kid friendly near water + sand.  If I did not need it for that, I would not be happy.<br /><br /> The video mode seemed to be decent also, not really interested in that aspect at the moment, but all sample videos I took inside or outside seemed to be decent quality.<br /><br />If I remember to I will update this review after further experience with this camera.",15,9,Nikon COOLPIX S32,5

shreesha,4,"Not the greatest quality, but also not the worst",2014-03-09,Y,"I just received my camera today, so I don't have all that much experience with it.  However, I did want to post my first impression of it so other customers have at least something to base their decision off of.    First off, I wanted to mention that I bought this camera because I want to be able to take photos and video in or near water and I don't trust myself to use my good cameras for that - I chose this one because my Kodak PlaySport crapped out after one use and this wasn't too expensive.  I was nervous preordering this, but so many other waterproof cameras had mixed reviews so I figured I'd give this one a shot.    This camera is VERY basic.  Something I'm not used to.  I own a Canon DSLR and a Canon point and shoot that both have manual modes and ways to adjust ISO and whatnot.  This camera doesn't even show you the ISO.  It has a few scene modes like night, macro, underwater, fireworks, etc.    The charging just completed, so I played around with it in the low light of my living room (haven't been able to try it in daylight yet).  The photos taken with the flash are pretty decent, but appear grainy when you zoom in closer on the computer screen.  If you printed one out in an 8 x 10 size, I don't think it would be very good quality.  The photos taken without the flash are very grainy.  The photos taken using zoom with or without the flash are very grainy.  The photos taken in macro mode are not clear at all.    The video quality in low light is absolutely terrible.  The sound is very low.  However, you can hear every click of the zoom button as I zoomed in and out.  I'll have to play around and see if any improvements can be made.    I'll keep it, because it seems good enough to have around the pool.  My fingers are crossed that the quality is better in daylight.    Will update as I use it more.    UPDATE 3/11/14 - I still haven't used it in daylight yet, but I just used the video function in the brighter light of our bathroom.  I thought about putting it inthe tub while I gave my daughter a bath to see how it holds up in water, but there really wasn't anything to take pictures/video of besides baby toes.  So I just recorded her splashing around a bit.  The quality in brighter light was actually a lot better.  The sound was so so.  I'm happy with the video for the most part.    UPDATE 3/14/14 - I finally used the camera in daylight.  The quality is good.  Not fantastic, but good.  The quality when you take a photo zoomed in on something still isn't very good, but it's passable.  I also changed my review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I've been comparing the quality to my DSLR and to my $350 point and shoot.  Those two cameras are obviously better quality, so it wasn't really fair of me to compare.  A few years ago, I had tried an inexpensive Fujifilm FinePix XP10 waterproof camera - it was pure crap.  This camera is far superior.  For what I paid for this camera and for what I intend to use it for, it appears to be a good choice.    UPDATE 9/22/14 - The summer is over and the camera turned out to be a useful purchase.  I got lots of great videos and photos of my daughter in the pool and at the beach.  It was nice to have a cheap, waterproof alternative to my DSLR or expensive point and shoot.  I never would've had pictures of my daughter's first time in a pool or first time in the ocean if I hadn't bought this camera, so I consider it a worthwhile purchase!",93,81,Nikon COOLPIX S32,1

I just need the photos for historical record with my engineering stamp on it for legal matters.    The camera does take good quality photos day or night. Except in does not have a optical viewfinder so photo taken outdoor are impossible to see on the back LED viewer in bright sunlight.",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX S3500 20.1MP Digital Camera with 7x Zoom,2

You'll want to buy a media card - I recommend a 64GB High Speed SDXC card, or a 32GB SDHC card; they'll give you plenty of room for photos or movie clips at a cheap price.

(If your Class 10 starts taking slower pictures .. see my fix below, under the cons section.)<br /><br />I have owned this for a year now and I love this camera.<br />PROS:<br />.Great Macro Pictures<br />.Fast picture taking with a Class 10 SD Card<br />.Rechargeable Battery (but I did have to tell the camera to charge wile on the computer)<br />.Versatile Settings<br />.Auto Focus<br />.Stabilization and vibration reduction<br />.Takes nice movies with sound (wind can be noisy though, even with wind reduction on)<br />.Fits on any standard Tripod<br />.Zoom actually WORKS and takes clear pictures (better with a tripod or a real steady hand though)<br />.Will &#34;BEEP&#34; when it is in focus (while is not 100% perfect, it allows you to take pictures when not looking at the screen.<br />.Battery lasts a long time. (Nearly my entire 16 gig card before running out) If you use the flash though, you cut that time to one fourth or one third.<br />.A partial press of the button will show where it is focusing, and can hold that focus as you wait for the right shot.<br />.Takes wonderful fireworks shots (So far the only night images that turned out fantastic)<br /><br />CONS:<br />.....Lower quality cards tend to make long pauses between pictures. Even my Class 10 card had an issue after a while. And started to freeze my camera to the point where I had to remove the battery to fix. I had to put the card in my computer and FORMAT the card then I used the camera &#34;format card&#34;....... it seems to have fixed the problem. Cards can go bad, so I am going to buy another SD card soon, just in case this one dies.<br />.No manual focus ; on certain settings you can choose the &#34;Focus Zone&#34; but that is not the same thing<br />.Twilight and night pictures pixelate and do not always focus well, You need a flash in the dark ... You can still get good images but do not expect SLR quality.<br />.Heat seems to affect the camera. I.E.

And I have noticed that a lot of my images are slightly &#34;blued&#34; I take a lot of flower images and one that is blue/purple comes out blue. Other flower shots are sometimes a little muted.<br />.Sometimes when I am holding the camera and using the flash, I tend to block the flash resulting in half shaded images. I have long fingers and it is a little camera. (I just have to remember to keep my fingers out of the way.)<br /><br />The biggest bonus for me was the rechargeable battery.

For snapshots shared online and 4 x 6 and 5 x 7 prints, the images are very good.<br /><br />2. Macro images taken with a zoom lens \\""optically optimized for normal shooting distances, they [the lenses] produce somewhat below-optimum image quality at close-up distances - particularly edge softness due to curvature of field.\\"" (Search on this phrase for an interesting article on the subject.)<br /><br />3. When significantly magnified, images appears to be a \\""soft focus\\"" or a little less than crystal clear.  This is due to \\""noise\\"" caused by the 20 million pixels on a small sensor about the size of your pinky fingernail. The pixels are too small to collect enough light to totally overcome the inherent electron noise in the sensor chip.  This pixel count \\""overkill\\"" requires the camera software to \\""smooth\\"" the image, resulting in an image that is less than crystal clear under magnification.  Example: a small sensor with 10 megapixels will result in a clearer picture than the same sized sensor with 20 megapixels. (See the website with the article \\""The difference in megapixels: Does it matter and how many are enough?\\""How Many Megapixels Do You Really Need?\\"")<br /><br />4. Learning when and how to use the few automatic focus options before taking important pictures is essential.  This camera (like any other camera) focuses sharply once the photographer understands how and when to use the various options.<br /><br />5. The camera needs an SD card with a speed rating of 6 or higher to shorten the time it takes for the camera to move the image file to the SD card.  Ditto for movies, which are quite good.  This will speed up the \\""shot-to-shot\\"" time that has been noted as an issue.  I use a card with a speed rating of 10.<br /><br />6. Making the image file size one step smaller than the factory settings also speeds up the image transfer, without any noticeable loss of image clarity or fidelity.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />My Nikon S3500 Quality Problem and Warranty Repair Experience<br /><br />After reading all the mostly positive reviews and having other Nikon cameras, I bought this camera as a travel camera instead of my more expensive Canon Elph 310 HS cameras.  (Travel as in \\""If a pickpocket takes my camera or if I lose it or drop it in the river, it's not that expensive, so what ever.\\"")<br /><br />I was surprised that the first photos weren't as sharp as the reviews led me to expect.  When I took it on a class field trip, our host took our group's picture.  I was on the far left, blurry and out of focus.<br /><br />To provide identification of the camera owner, I always take a a macro picture of my business card before we left on the trip.  It was very out of focus on the left.<br /><br />I contacted Nikon service, who requested a picture.  After trying a full camera reset, with the same results, she said send it to Nikon Warranty Service (which is done by Precision Camera in Enfield Connecticut, a contractor, not Nikon).  It took one week from the day USPS says Precision Camera received the camera to the day it appeared on the Precision Camera website as \\""Received\\"". I had called after the USPS said they delivered it to them.  It took three days before someone apologetically returned my call and said they were working on it.<br /><br />I received the repaired camera several days later. The far left side of a Macro picture was much less blurry.  The right and left edges for non-macro pictures settings were now slightly \\""soft\\"" focus, according to the Nikon customer service rep on the Nikon website.  (I discovered that the camera's \\""view the image\\"" function works well with the zoom control so small areas of the image can be magnified just as one would do on a computer.)<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you test all the functions and review the image quality of this or any camera that you buy within one week of receipt.  If there are problems, you can quickly return it to Amazon (a superb company to do business with) for a refund or a replacement.  Otherwise, the warranty service is your only option.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Here is how I took focus test pictures:<br /><br />1.  Using an 8 1/2 by 11 inch piece of graph paper (1/4 inch boxes), and placing a small 6\\"" ruler on the paper, using natural sunlight through the window, I took several Macro test shots, ensuring that the image was completely on the graph paper.<br /><br />2.  For normal and zoom pictures, I took pictures of the front of a house with bricks.  I took pictures of the brick exterior wall (like giant graph paper).<br /><br />I viewed the pictures on my computer using magnification to look at the lines and edges to determine their clarity.",3,2,Nikon COOLPIX S3500 20.1MP Digital Camera with 7x Zoom,4

Vanitha,3,Hit and Miss,2014-04-08,N,"An attractive, easy to use and reasonably priced pocket camera. That's the good news.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the image quality varies considerably. Sometimes it's quite OK. But, all too often it's decidedly soft with poor detail and washed out colors. Of course, you can make adjustments using the photo editing program on your PC. However, you really shouldn't have to do all this just to get decent, basic snaps. Indeed, the fact that such doctoring is required indicates that something is terribly wrong. Put simply, the camera is failing to capture the true and accurate appearance of the subject.<br /><br />The problem seems to be caused by the Nikon's inability to perform consistently well in changing light conditions. Also,  I've noticed that when I'm taking a lot of photos in rapid sequence, every second shot appears to be slightly out of focus which possibly indicates that there's a problem with the auto focus failing to reset quickly enough. As other reviewers have mentioned, this camera operates very slowly<br /><br />And while you might be able to add a touch of zing to improve the look of flat pics, you'll never know, for sure, if the end result bears much, if any, resemblance to the real thing.<br /><br />In summary : Hit and Miss",2,2,Nikon COOLPIX S3500 20.1MP Digital Camera with 7x Zoom,4

Gautam Dey,1,Slow Shutter Speed - 80% of Vacation Photos Ruined!,2015-06-12,N,"After several years of promising to take more pictures (my annual New Year's resolution, 5 years), I finally bought a Canon and used it throughout France and Spain.  When it was stolen halfway through my trip, I went to a European big box store and picked up this camera, rather than the same Canon, because of its better zoom feature.  80% of photos came out AWFUL. A fuzzy blur.<br /><br />Biggest flaw: Sllllow shutter speed.  If you take photos in low light (read: any pictures after dusk), your pictures will come out grainy, blurry, and entirely unclear.  The shutter speed (even after adjusting to a variety of settings) is so slow, it takes 7-8 seconds after clicking the button to capture the photo.  Consequently, no photos taken in evening came out.",2,2,Nikon COOLPIX S3600 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and 720p HD Video,5

I have finally set the ISO setting down to 800 and have to rely on the nikon photo program (that came with the camera) to create sharp pictures.

Rameshwar,1,THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING NIKON,2015-06-04,N,"In 4/15 I bought model S6800 (another point and shoot similar to this model) only to find it came with a Quick Start booklet but NO COMPREHENSIVE PRINTED MANUAL. All you get is a link to a PDF.  So, you must learn and memorize the camera before you go out and take pictures OR take your laptop with you OR print-out the PDF & carry its 250 pages on 250 sheets of 8-1/2 x 11 paper in your backpack.<br /><br />Called Customer Care asking them for a Printed manual.  After elevating the call twice, a manager gave me “corporatespeak” that Nikon has “gone green” - doing good for the environment by saving paper. So, my printing 250 pages of manual on 250 sheets of 8-1/2 x 11 paper is green?  How about: &#34;we can up the profit per unit by 50 cents if we don't print manuals (on a camera that is priced at about $130 –really now!).”  I was told that no printed manuals exist. It’s clear to me that they used to because the PDF page format is the same 5” x 5” page size of the Quick Start Guide.  I find it hard to believe that they wouldn’t have some around to make customers happy who ask for them. Wrong. I was told that they do not.  The “corporatespeak” was like a broken record; nothing in the conversations I had with three people at Nikon that gave any indication that they cared one iota about making me a happy customer.<br /><br />Getting nowhere, and recognizing that those to whom I had spoken were scripted in what they were to say, have no authority, and are trained to bar to the public’s access to executives who have authority, I asked for the name or at least the title and address of an executive to whom I could write a letter.  I was told that they were not allowed to give this information over the phone (not even the address?)  and that it was all available on the website.  I looked.  There is none; at least I found none after 25 minutes of searching.  It is clear that they don’t want their senior executives to be contacted and they don’t care about any inconvenience to the customer. Talk about being out of touch with your market.<br /><br />I bought the Nikon to replace my 10-year old Canon, a company from which on several occasions I received very attentive service.  I wanted to try a different experience and bought the Nikon brand given my wife’s experience with Nikon years ago.<br /><br />This is clearly a company that has lost its way in customer satisfaction.  I am kicking myself for patronizing a company with such a callous lack of customer sensitivity because I recall reading reviews that said that Nikon’s service stunk.  I blew these reviews off – intent on buying on blind faith.  What a fool.  When I look at my Nikon, the humility of the bad decision I made makes me feel betrayed, disgusted. Doesn’t matter whether the camera itself is good or not.<br /><br />Fortunately for you consumers, there’s a myriad of other brands to choose from.  Too bad Nikon doesn’t get it.",5,2,Nikon COOLPIX S3600 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and 720p HD Video,5

I have installed & uninstalled the program several times, my computer does indeed recognize the camera under &#34;Portable Devices&#34;, I have followed all the troubleshooting instructions, but no pictures come up to download.  I have tried everything.  Completely worthless and now my vacation photos are stuck on a card with no way to view them.  This camera is much worse than total trash....

Taroteer - Tarot reader,1,No more Nikon Products for Me,2015-02-16,Y,"My camera has the &#34;battery exhausted&#34; problem noted elsewhere on the web.  A freshly-charged battery will appear discharged after several short sessions of shooting (less than 20 shots total).  I purchased another genuine Nikon battery and have the same problem -- so it's not the battery.  I even purchased a separate battery charger; thinking that there might be a problem with trying to charge the battery through USB.  Still no help.  Similar Nikon Coolpix  models have firmware updates to fix this problem -- this now-discontinued model has no firmware update.  What a way to fix the problem, Nikon!  I tried to fill out a warranty claim for the camera, but was denied by the Nikon website.  Not sure if it is a temporary website problem or not.  I will try a live call next.  I will not be buying any more Nikon products after this experience !!!",0,0,Nikon COOLPIX S3600 20.1 MP Digital Camera with 8x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and 720p HD Video,2

I have to manually remove the SD card and slide it into the computer to retrieve the pictures.<br />It now tells me ( on the display) the SD card isn't the right one. This thing is a pile of junk. i have to mail it back to nikon and probably get a &#34;refurbished one&#34;<br />Should have bought a CANON camera<br />nikon's customer service is useless, they said they would send me a new charging cord then later changed their minds and didn't send it. They failed to notify me and just left me hanging. 10 days later I called them to ask about the order status and they said &#34; sorry we dont send out new cords until we receive the old cord&#34; I'm not going to waste my time mailing back just the cord.<br />Not only is the camera junk, so it their customer service.<br />Now I read the camera is DISCONTINUED BY MANUFACTURER. it figures. Update: Nikon's fix it division tells me that I broke the camera by inserting the charging cord wrong and want $99.50 to fix a $75 camera.WHAT?.... Run dont walk away from nikon and their crummy warranty. Buyer beware!  Update, Nikon sent another camera 9 months later. This one did the same thing. After about 125 pictures it would not charge or upload pictures to the computer.  I put the camera in a vise and crushed it. What a piece of Junk.

The one disappointment I have had is that after taking only 91 pictures, the camera ran out of memory and I had to upload the photos on my computer in order to clear the memory.  Perhaps it's because of the amount of megapixels, the amount of times I zoomed in and out, or the fact I only had an 8mb card for the memory.  Whatever the reason I ran out of memory, that I would say is my greatest disappointment.  But I do like the quality of the pictures and the fact it is lightweight.

I like that it is a little heavy and I like the rubberized type of covering on it. No, it does not replace my Nikon, but it does what I want.

I am a novice photographer and my last camera which was a simple point and shoot was impossible to use!  I couldn't figure out how to do hardly anything, not to mention it took horrible pictures.  I lead a youth group and most of the pics I take are of the kids playing games and during the lesson and praise and worship.  the church basement is dark and I couldn't get a decent pic unless I was right in someone's face with the flash on.  So far, I love this camera. After spending just a little time reading the manual I have figured out how to do most of the basic things that I will be using the camera for.  I haven't tried the dark basement yet, since I just got the camera today, but I am excited to see how it works.  I took it outside and tried some zoom shots and they turned out great!  The first thing I noticed is the clarity even on the view screen!  I am going to Israel in January and that is why I upgraded to a new camera (besides being totally disgusted with the old one) and I am excited to see how the zoom works and also how all the scenery photos will turn out!

Thokozani Clement Kefasi,5,"Nice Point-and-Shoot camera, great lens.",2015-08-14,Y,This camera was purchased after reviewing what other customers had posted. My experience has been the same.  With distant subjects (the 30X end of the optic) the auto-focus seems to get confused. A monopod would help with the manual focus-assist control if you're not ALSO trying to hand-hold a steady frame.,0,0,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2
Parekh,2,LOVE everything about it ... everything but the image quality ;/,2015-08-13,Y,"I really, REALLY like this camera.  But the images have no detail upon close inspection (various settings, various contexts tried in three weeks of use).  Seriously, they're a BLUR (?!).  I'm no professional, but no other Lumix has disappointed me this way.  I don't know how some reviewers are having a different experience, but other users report similar blur and smear with this product as well.  The ZS40 was my third Lumix (well, fourth, considering the first exchange due to sensor debris), and despite the sad facts that a Lumix doesn't seem to last long before expiring (got this to replace broken ZS20, which I liked other than its touch-screen, and which lasted one year before the lens made a crunching noise and got stuck); and Panasonic's customer service is lacking (they wouldn't replace under warranty, etc.), I have been a die-hard Lumix fan (in part because the video, particularly sound recording, at least with the DMC-ZR3, has been SHOCKINGLY good [imagine no distorted audio from even front-row rock concerts!]).  Anyway, due to financial limitations and relatively high standards, I do a LOT of research before buying a product like this.  So, I did my homework.  The reviews and specs are good for the ZS40.  Better in some ways than what I was replacing: the ZS20.  But I did not find the upgrade to be worth it.  I am THRILLED with the design of this camera.  No touch-screen to torture me (would be fine if you could turn if OFF, but you can't), a viewfinder for when needed, great in the hand (the slightly &#34;rubberized&#34; matte finish is delicious feeling and kinda gorgeous), fantastic auto-focus, etc.  And the zoom is great.  But absolutely NOTHING is worth the loss of image quality in the end.  I chatted with Panasonic about this, as well as photographer friends.  Panasonic effectively shrugged via chat, and my expert-y friends said that Panasonic crammed too-big a zoom into a little camera (sorry for the lack of technical eloquence there) and basically screwed the image quality.  Since my ZS20 seemed fine (20x zoom vs. 30x), I think they're right.  Again, I love this camera.  But I need details and crop-ability in my images, so it's going back.  Sad to be losing the rest of the camera, but I would be wasting most shots I take, since I use it more for art than anything else, and I need crisp detail.  (The macro capabilities seemed good to me, but I didn't test them much.)  Bottom-line:  If you're only going to post your mostly well-lit images -- that don't require much zoom and without much cropping -- on Facebook, this camera might be great for you.  Or perhaps if you take a lot of video (I didn't notice much problem there for my purposes), it'd be good for you.  But if you want to zoom in, crop, enjoy details and sharpness of images, I'd say keep looking.  I gave the ZS40 two stars because three stars means, it's &#34;okay,&#34; and the image quality isn't if you look (literally) closely, at least not with the ZS40 I got.  I may be moving on from Panasonic now.  I'd get a DSLR, but I can't use something that bulky, so I'm considering a &#34;bridge&#34; camera or a hot, Sony Alpha, which is mirrorless DSLR, and thus, compact  (huge transition, for the latter, though, to adjust to interchangeable lenses).  Hope that was helpful, and good luck!  UPDATE, days later:  I used the ZS40 one more time to test its powers before returning it.  I took it to the beach.  Again, the image quality improves with sunlight (a LOT of it [wow, was I reminded how much a camera needs a viewfinder]), but then I am faced with Panasonic only providing one battery and no (ext.) charger.  I missed SO MUCH because they did this: the end of a friend's very special concert the first week I had the ZS40, and worst, the second day of my recent trip, battery ran out (with little warning, also, just so you know) and I had to use my dirty-sensored (faulty design puts spots on it) old Lumix.  Also lost an epic sunset (thanks, Lumix-makers, you reallycare about your customers [insert string of profanities]).  All because I couldn't charge the ONE proprietary ZS40 battery.  But more because Panasonic decided its customers and camera weren't worth a second battery.  Sadly, I couldn't have a backup like with my other Lumix, that appropriately CAME WITH TWO.  Or a charger.  The former being most important.  Yes, you can buy back-ups later, but I'm not investing until I know I'm KEEPING the camera (it's not like I could ever use them with any other product in the world [another evil in itself]).  I would love to move to another brand simply because of this.  The shots and video I lost during my trial of this camera due to dead battery is just sickening.  Bad move, poor corporate-logic driven company.  Unless you really have to, maybe skip Panasonic just for their stingy, self-concerned ways.  No, they don't give you a strap, either.",9,6,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,4

Sangeetha,1,Great Camera - WHEN it works,2015-07-27,Y,"I LOVE this camera when it works. Great pics, simple, super set of functions, great panaromas, zoom, picture quality etc. I bought it to travel with and therein lies the problem. Having traveled in Central America for a few months the camera started to have some issues. The first one was that the software in the &#34;Scene&#34; and other multi-function modes would &#34;bounce&#34; on the first item not allowing you to set it. The problem was intermittant at first but soon became permanent. Oh well, I still have the automatic mode, right. Well, yes, until the screen starts to go intermittantly blank you do... Then eventually it develops a problem where it won't turn on at all - intermittently...<br /><br />If I were not traveling the solution would be easy - return it for service under warranty. Try that when you are on an island in the Caribbean for 6 months where it takes 10 weeks and $350 to get a small package delivered from the States! Online support is no use - they just tell you to reset it to factory defaults - impossible with no screen to look at. Then you simly return it to customer service - impossible, so you carry a small brick in your pack in the hope that at some point in the future once your warranty has expired you stumble upon a Panasonic Sevice Center who may be able to fix it for about the same price as a new one.<br /><br />I would have been less irritated if it were not specifically being sold as a &#34;Travel&#34; camera, and that's all I am trying to do...",4,2,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,6

I don't know why cameras do not have an optical viewfinder at least .<br />I had a Pentax X-5 before , but after 2 vacations I decided I don't like carrying around a big camera and I think some of the people on our cruise thought I was the ship photographer . This will fit in a big pocket . Sony makes a smaller model but the flash and viewfinder pop up , I would rather the camera be ready to shoot quickly . Some here complain about the cable , but it is the same as my Pentax , so it is not propriety . I like charging the battery in the camera , I don't want to have to take it out , and since it is good for 300+ shots , extras are not needed . I have used the wifi to transfer to my phone with no trouble but not to my apple computer . It may be possible but require IP addresses and passwords from what I have read , but not tried yet . I did transfer using the cable , though . Pictures look great even ones taken with full optical and digital zoom . A lot of people use phone cameras to take pictures and they look good on the phone screen but not so good on a big screen . These look great .<br /><br />Camera comes with a printed basic manual only . The full manual is over 300 pages and comes on disc that is only for PC . Not even available on Panasonic website .

Recent experiences with Panasonic and now the Z40 will keep me away from Panasonic. The big problem: the camera screen would not go on after having taken about 30 pictures prior to this problem occurring. I know how to use a camera including the button that is supposed to turn the screen on and off. Even the viewfinder was dark. I tried turning the camera off for 15 minutes and even removing and re-inserting the card and battery. Nothing worked and I was not able to take pictures. A few hours later the same day, I turned the camera on and it worked fine. I have never had a camera before that failed me during an important camera session while traveling.

Unfortunately I've been disappointed -- and I've purchased two of these units and spent time on the phone with Panasonic support to no avail.

Dibs.....,2,At least for me: Doesn't live up to it's rep.,2015-06-15,Y,"I originally ordered this to replace my Panasonic ZS7 which I have had for 3-4 years and I have really liked as it takes for the most part really nice pictures under all sorts of conditions. Bottom line: I have gone back to this as my Point and Shoot and have returned the ZS40S.<br />The ZS40S just has not lived up to it's hype.  I thought with the higher resolution and being &#34;newer&#34; it would be an upgrade; but that has not been the case.  First thing I noticed was the ZS40S is a lot of plastic. The ZS7 much more metal and solid feel.  At times the ZS40S can produce really nice pictures, but MANY other times for me it produces substandard, poorly exposed pics.  And even with RAW and PS still can't get them to look right.  It could be me and not learning how to use this camera, but hey, it is a Point and Shoot. I should just be able to do just that and get decent pics.  I always seemed to be able to do that with the ZS7.<br />Bottom line is I now use my Sony Alpha 6000 for many of my pics (with the kit lens it is pretty compact and takes very nice pics), and when I can't cart that around I have just gone back to my old 12 MegPix ZS7 and am pretty happy.",3,2,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,3

Dhiya krishna,5,Absolutely great features !,2015-06-12,Y,"I've owned several of the ZS series over the years and have been very happy with them. Even though there was a newer version of this one available<br />I chose this one because the newer one doesn't have the gps. I do a lot of outdoor photography and it's often hard to remember where some of the shots were taken and thus the gps feature is a great help. This is my first ZS series with a viewfinder and I love it. I don't have to wear my reading glasses and I can access most of the menu . Plus it's essential on bright days and for framing shots.. Some reviews have mentioned the small size and low resolution of the view finder but I didn't really have any issues with either. Both the size and resolution were more than adequate. In fact, I'm using the view finder about 90% of the time. The ZS40 is loaded with great features including a movable ring around the lens that can be programed to be used as a zoom, EV adjustment  or several other uses while still giving the option to use the traditional buttons/levers at the same time. The only con for me so far is the size. All of the nice features have added bulk which is less ideal for me. I had to get a larger belt case plus the added weight is more noticeable. It would have been nice to retain the size and weight of my ZS 7. But I think the added features, including  the great zoom range offset the issue of size and weight. The camera has produced pictures with solid image quality. I would recommend this camera with many great features. Another win for Panasonic.",3,3,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5

There's a trick to getting it to take 120 frame per second footage.  You can't dial that in with the direct settings.  Instead, use the Scene modes (SCN on the top dial) and then pick HS (high speed) from the many offered scene modes.  You'll get 120 fps and full use of the zoom.  At long distances, you'll need a tripod since even a slight movement of the camera body shifts the subject dramatically.",5,5,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,4
Shiv Kumar,4,Great pocket camera for photo savvy travellers,2015-04-20,Y,"Bought this for traveling and well pleased - l love the camera. Photo quality is excellent both on automatic settings and the many manual choices. Camera is easy to use immediately, but will take time to learn the extended functions. If you just want a basic point and click, there are better and cheaper choices out there. This is perfect for intermediate photographers looking for a portable, pocket size camera to bridge the gap between compact cameras and a full blown digital SLR.<br /><br />My main criticism so far is the software/app for transferring media via wifi to your computer/tablet etc. There is no easy way to transfer all pictures and each one has to be selected individually - a considerable chore and time waster. Much easier to pull the card and use a reader but that isn't always an option when traveling.

I couldn't ask for better in a non-DSLR). There are two reasons for docking one star:<br />1) As others have noted, Panasonic chose to go with a proprietary charger for this rather than standard micro USB. Stupid.<br />2) More importantly from a usage perspective, the flash and the grip on the camera are not well-located. I don't know whether it's because I have large hands, but unless I'm paying strict attention to where I'm holding the camera, I have a tendency to partially block the flash, causing nasty shadows and dark spots in my shots.<br />Ultimately I've come to really like this camera, but having to pay attention to how I grip it means I can't LOVE it the way I'd like to.",17,17,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,6

Amrit Joshi,2,Misses the mark,2015-04-04,Y,"I really wanted to like this camera. Out of the box, it's comfortable to hold and lightweight. I immediately took it outside to test it out.<br /><br />The first annoyance was the flash, so, as per usual, I turned it off. Surprise! If you turn the camera off, and then back on - it turns the flash on again, and there doesn't seem to be a way to keep it from doing that. Strike one for me as I rarely use flash.<br /><br />Strike two was the image quality. I own a Sony RX100 mk3, which has killer sharp images. The Panasonic images were fuzzy and filled with noise. Granted, I was shooting outside on a grey-day, but still, I can't imagine printing one out as a 16x20&#34; print as extolled in the company's literature.<br /><br />Strike three was not Panasonic's faulty, but Amazon Warehouse deals fault - no usb cable or AC adapter. What IS Panasonic's fault is using a proprietary cable system. Shame. So when I received the camera there was no way to charge it.<br /><br />It's nice to have a viewfinder (albeit it VERY small), but other issues with this camera (like image quality and the flash) forced me to return it. I recently purchased a Sony DSC-W350 which is a more compact sized camera, with a shorter, 20x zoom, no view finder, and no manual controls, but the image quality is far superior. Either Panasonic needs to improve their image quality and flash control, or Sony needs to add a viewfinder and manual controls - to make a high-zoom camera that is user-friendly.",7,5,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2
roshan,4,Nice size and weight - still learning features,2015-04-02,Y,"Liking it so far.  I'm a novice photographer, so it's taking a bit of learning.  The CD is for PCs only.  You can't load the photo editing program on a Mac.  But you can access the Owner's Manual for Advance Features.  If you are a novice like me, skip the Basics Owner's Manual (the paper version included in the box) and download the Advanced Features one.  It goes through everything step-by-step.<br /><br />The camera is very compact and light and will be great for traveling.  It does not include a charger you can plug directly into a wall outlet, so I bought one seperate: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D2CSIUW/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11.  Now if my battery dies, I can still venture out with the camera while another battery is charging at home.<br /><br />I also bought 2 cases for it and they both fit perfectly.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JCOF6AO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9 -- this is only big enough to hold the camera, but it fits like a glove.  I can have my hands free until I want to take a picture.  I wear it with the shoulder strap, cross body.  I guess I could tote a battery and memory card in my pocket.  The second case is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Y4NWQE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10  -- Again, a very good fit and it has a side pocket that I've been able to fit both a battery and a memory card (in its case) easily.  I plan to use this case if I'm toting a purse or backpack and want to give the camera  a little protection.  It won't save it if it's dropped, but it won't get scratched and the case is very compact.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if I should give the camera 5 stars or not.

Sasirekha,4,A Really Good Compact Camera with a Remarkable Optical Zoom,2015-03-29,Y,"I bought this camera for its small size and large optical zoom lens. I take lots of pictures and was tired of carrying a DSL camera and lenses. I have had the camera a couple of months and have taken perhaps 300 pictures.  I got the ZS-40 because it had a viewfinder in addition to the LCD screen. The viewfinder is small but a life-saver in bright sunny condition. One of the negatives is that the viewfinder shuts off on certain settings of the camera. Also as you are using the viewfinder, your nose touches the LCD screen - be sure to put on a screen protector. On the whole I have been pleasantly surprised with the performance of the camera. It takes very fine photos even with high optical zoom settings. I think the WIFI feature is an added benefit - I have used this to transfer pictures to a cell phone to send them to folks by email and have also used my cell phone as a remote control for the camera. The WIFI features are a bit tricky but do work after some figuring out. While I am sure that the pictures from this camera are not quite as good as a DSL or even a less compact point and shoot, my photos so far are pretty good and I am much more likely to take this camera everywhere so the tradeoff is quite worthwhile.",1,1,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5
Shreyaa,1,DON'T BUY FROM PANASONIC,2015-03-28,N,"Technical Service Panasonic,<br /><br />I write to you to express my disappointment as a client because I feel betrayed by Panasonic.<br />In November 2013, I bought a digital camera, Lumix ZS 30, intended for my vacation in Patagonia during the months of January and February. The camera came defective, leaving black spots in all my pictures and also ruining the record of beautiful and unforgettable moments. When I returned to the US, I consulted the warranty and sent the item to Texas, explaining the problem and hoping it would be fixed. They promised a replacement unit. It was not so, as I received back the same camera. I tried it and it apparently worked well, so I had nothing to complain and remain, let us say, &#34;satisfied&#34;.<br />I spent a few months in January and February 2015 abroad again, and the same thing happened after a few days: dark spots in the pictures. Two ruined vacations, and this time I became upset and knew I had not bought a good camera.<br />But worst of all was to come. When I contacted technical support a second time, the &#34;technician&#34; who spoke with me explained that the period of 1 year warranty had expired, and that I &#34;had not been responsible enough to communicate with Panasonic&#34; after the serviced camera was returned to me months earlier, and while Panasonic had been &#34;generous&#34; to repair my camera during the first year, the problems of the camera were no longer Panasonic's problems.<br /><br />I want you to know that you not only lost a client, but if Panasonic generally treats its customers so rudely, this will have larger implications for your company in the long term. To offer a warranty is not a favor, it is a commitment. This commitment was not fulfilled, and I am left feeling betrayed.",43,31,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2

Amazon Customer,5,... so it wasn't working properly anymore This is the perfect camera if you would like to get quality pictures ...,2015-03-21,Y,I bought this camera as I had an older version (I believe it was zs10) and dropped it. This is the perfect camera if you would like to get quality pictures but still want a small one that fits in you pocked/purse. Pros: -I has a wifi so you can connect it to your smart phone and use it as a remote control -30 times optical zoom which is pretty good for a small camera -It also has a built in level to show you if you are holding it straight or not -a viewfinder which is convenient if you want to switch off your screen to save battery - my previous one didn't have it.  Cons: - No touch screen - this is a downgrade from the old camera - Also don't like the fact that it has a different battery from the old one - would have been good to use my old battery as a spare.

Karamjeet,3,Defective out of the box and had to be returned,2015-03-21,Y,This camera looks like it has all the features we wanted and had some good reviews before we ordered it.  We bought it to take on vacation and it immediatly had problems opening and closing the automatic lens cover.  After only 4 uses the lens cover was permanently jammed half way open rendering the camera useless.  We have had a Panasonice Lumix camera before and really liked it so I am not sure what went wrong with this one.  I hope that this was just one defective camera.  On the plus side Amazon made the return very easy for us and quickly refunded the money we spent.  The return policy and ease of use is the only reason I gave it a 3 star rating at this time.

I do a lot of hiking and backpacking so the tiny size is important.... no longer do I need to lug a whole camera bag full of lenses to do what this does.  The whole thing weighs less than a single lens in my camera bag.  The quality of the images is on a par with those of my big DSLR .  The 30x optical zoom  can make macro shots at a distance thus giving greater depth of field and eliminating the problem of getting the camera so close to the subject that the subject is shaded..... great for flower shots.  Thus an image of a penny (taken from 5 feet) can be blown up to over 10 inches before any pixilation can begin to  be seen.  Also, it has a digital viewfinder which eliminates the need for the old-fashioned mirror found in film SLRs and DSLRs and it eliminates the problem of not seeing the screen in bright sun.  You can switch between viewfinder and screen at the push of a button.  There are very few cameras with this useful feature.",4,4,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2

Nitish,5,"Meets all the tradeoffs you might expect of a high-quality superzoom, pocket-sized camera.",2015-03-09,Y,"I had a tough time deciding between 4 and 5 stars.  The point is, NO camera is absolutely perfect at everything.  There are always tradeoffs such as full control vs. full auto, superzoom vs. image quality, compactness vs. flexibility, and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />So, this camera got 5 stars for the following reasons:<br />- It looks gorgeous - great feel, well-built.<br />- I thought the Viewfinder was neat, but now that i have it, I wouldn't order a camera without one.  I'm almost 50 and my eyes are always struggling these days.  Focsuing in with one eye in the viewfinder is so simple, instant - and reduces power consumption by a good margin.<br />- The wi-fi options are kinda neat - but I gotta say - they aren't what I'd consider simple.  Popping a memory card out and plugging it into a laptop is more simple, for sure.  Still, it offers some great flexibility.<br />- The features and control options are well thought out.  I'm a hobbyist, and love playing with depth of field, etc.  This camera doesn't have a wide enough aperture to really get creative - but you still get to play plenty with shutter speeds, etc.  The auto modes even give you some interesting control.<br />- Pictures aren't nearly as &#34;reliable&#34; as my DSLR, but when traveling, I never take my DSLR....  So you have to accept some limitations.<br />- Zoom is incredible, I mean 720mm equivalent?  Wow.<br /><br />Don't have any remorse - and glad I purchased this.<br /><br />Update, a few weeks in.  Wish it had a faster lens, but...  What do you expect?  Pictures I've tsken in light or with close flash are really nice!  And I figured out some wifi options that work nicely. Still easier for memory card though! :-).  Can't go wrong.",21,21,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,4

Shiji Jacob Eapen,5,In my opinion this may be the very best Panasonic camera ever -- for us at least,2015-03-04,Y,"We have several Panasonic cameras ranging from tiny, inexpensive pocketable ones to bigger bulkier ones in the FZ series.<br /><br />In my opinion this may be the very best Panasonic camera ever -- for us at least.<br /><br />What I love about it:<br /><br />1.  It has a real, full coverage, adjustable for your vision,  full information viewfinder.  Something I've longed for in these smaller cameras but have never found until this one.  Yes, it's teeny tiny itsy bitsy, and oddly placed, but it's there  -- and it works.<br /><br />2.  It has three different choices for zoom.  One, the typical lever type on the top of the camera and then two addition options with the back wheel and the lens ring.  Best part?  Two of the choices actually give you the equivalent 35mm focal length (i.e. 200mm) rather than the more typical and expected &#34;8X&#34;.<br /><br />3.  It has real spot focusing and the spot focusing STAYS PUT until you elect to change it, no matter how many times you turn the camera on and off in the meantime.<br /><br />4.  Has a superbly long maximum focal length (approximately 700mm) without going into digital.<br /><br />Did I mention it has a real, diopter adjustable, full-information viewfinder?  ;-D<br /><br />I love this camera!  Am considering buying another so we can each carry one.<br /><br />My one and only complaint is that for some reason Panasonic seems to not be aware of how their customers actually use their cameras and they have started NOT including a separate plug-in charger.  They seem to think their users will always be near a computer and will never run out of battery power before being able to access one with which to charge the battery -- inside the camera.  Of course that means the camera is out of commission too until the battery is recharged.  Totally impractical!  I can go through a battery in a day of shooting easily (so need at least one extra) and need to recharge at night, often in hotel rooms where I do not have a computer.  Because of that I purchased a Wasabi charger with an extra couple of batteries to go with this camera (as I have also had to do with a couple of other recently purchased Panasonic cameras).<br /><br />Despite that one caveat, I do really love this camera and consider it to be just about perfect for travel, hiking and any other time when you simply don't want to (or can't) take a bigger DSLR or bridge camera.ecause of that I purchased a Wasabi charger with an extra couple of batteries to go with this camera (as I have also had to do with a couple of other recently purchased Panasonic cameras).<br /><br />Despite that one caveat, I do really love this camera and consider it to be just about perfect for travel, hiking and any other time when you simply don't want to (or can't) take a bigger DSLR or bridge camera.",7,7,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5

sunil,5,Pleased with Panasonic Lumix SZ40,2015-02-18,Y,"I purchased the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS40, with 30x zoom, as a travel cameral. My requirement was for a camera that would fit into my pocket, would have GPS to label the photos, would produce good quality photos for display on my iMac, and would cost less than $400.  These constraints narrowed the choices considerably.<br /><br />The camera was to be a replacement for a broken Canon PowerShot SX230  (14x, 12.1 MP, popup flash, with GPS) and an earlier sensor-blemished Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS-6 (12x , 12.1 MP, builtin flash, No GPS), both of which produced satisfactory pictures and had satisfactory zoom. I also use a DSLR camera, a Canon EOS DSLR XSi (12.2 MP) with interchangeable lenses that cover some of the range of the Lumix; it has been my “serious” camera.<br /><br />I understood that there would be a tradeoff between zoom and low-light sensitivity, but the top rated low-zoom low-light pocket cameras were priced at more than $400, so I ruled them out.<br /><br />I would have been content with a 12x zoom, or the 20x zooms of last years Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Samsung and Sony, but it seems that the newest auxiliary technology is being placed into 30x zooms, at a comparable price. So the contenders I considered were<br /><br /> Canon Powershot SX700HS (30x, 16.2 MP, popup flash, No GPS, $280-$350)<br /> Nikon Coolpix S9700  (30x, 16 MP, popup flash, Yes GPS, $280)<br /> Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS-40 (30x, 18.1 MP built-in flash, Yes GPS, $350,)<br /> Sony Cyber-Shot HX60V  (30x, 20MP, popup flash, Yes, GPS, $370)<br /><br />The several detailed online reviews I read  gave me the impression that the quality of the construction and the images was fairly similar in these competitors. But there were notable differences that ultimately determined my choice.<br /><br />The Canon SX700 requires an iPhone (or other) connection to do GPS, so this made that camera much less desirable.<br /><br />The popup flash unit on the Nikon S9700 and the Canon SX700 seemed to me to bereadily damaged, though I have not read complaints of this; the Lumix flash is built in, always ready (though it can be turned off or made to flash automatic).<br /><br />The Lumix had several features that set it apart from all competitors, and in the end these (and the perceived drawbacks of other cameras) were decisive. The Lumix has an electronic viewer in addition to the big screen on the back, and this is very valuable for shots in bright sun. It has a second control dial, surrounding the lens, in addition to the one on the rear, and this has turned out to be useful.<br /><br />I have been pleased with the quality of images, as compared with my DSLR Canon EOS  XSi (12.2 MP)  with interchangeable lenses. The low light images are not too different with the two very different systems. Image stabilization works about as well for me in both of these cameras, so basically I am getting about the same quality image with my Lumix pocket camera as I do with the bulkier older DSLR, and the Lumix has features such as movie mode and GPS which the old Canon EOS lacks.<br /><br />The Lumix responds very quickly to being turned on: it is ready to take a standard non-zoom shot with very little delay. That is a great benefit for a travel camera. It takes longer to turn off, which it does with a display of a bright white display screen.<br /><br />The Lumix has numerous dial-chosen settings as do the competitors. I have found that the basic iA (intelligent auto) works best: it is hard to be more clever than this in choosing such alternatives as portraits or landscapes. However, the sunsets setting has enabled me to finally get the sunset shots that none of my other digital cameras could manage to get.<br /><br />Although I generally do needed cropping and retouching after transferring my photos to an iMac, the Lumix has an option for “Retouching” that I have found does a great job of bringing out pictures taken in low light — better than what I generally do with the Aperture app. I do well to make this alteration in the camera rather than with Apple software.<br /><br />The camera is pretty easy to use, although I have to take care not to press the wrong location on the case and inadvertently invoke some feature or mode of operation— an error that cameras of this size are apt to have. The small paper manual and the larger pdf manual are helpful in pointing out features, of which there are a great many. The online reviews are also of some help in identifying the various features that can be of use, as one goes beyond point-ant-shoot. In the hands of experts the camera does very well indeed.<br /><br />The Lumix has features that I do not use. It has face recognition, but I do that on my iMac computer, where it is more easily done.  The Lumix allows wireless connection to an iPhone, but I do not have one. It allows wireless connection to a computer, but to do this you have to enter various identifiers into the camera, using what for me was a very clumsy interface, familiar to kids who use messaging phones, but too frustrating for me, particularly when trying to enter a password.<br /><br />There are a few characteristics that were a little disappointing. The GPS does not seem as good as an iPhone at getting a signal, and it often fails to know coordinates. However, the display can be set to reveal the status of the GPS connection, so you can see whether the location is going to be part of the metadata. I found that when there is no connection there is nonetheless some (erroneous)  information entered in the latitude and longitude, and this shows up in the metadata revealed by the Aperture app on my iMac. The data is basically nonsense and does not allow plotting of the location on the “Places” map. But of course you can enter a location independent of this data. When I made a connection outdoors it was maintained inside our car or inside buildings.<br /><br />The Lumix comes without an SD card for image storage. That was not a problem for me, because I have several of these cards. And I bought another newer and larger-capacity image card.<br /><br />The ZS40 battery is not the same size as that of my earlier Lumix ZS6 (the newer one is smaller), and so I cannot use the batteries and battery charger that I bought for that. But these are available inexpensively online and I have bought these. On travel one is wise to carry a spare battery.<br /><br />In the past two Panasonic Lumix ZS cameras have developed irreparable spots on the sensor, perhaps from dust inside the camera. Nevertheless, I have again chosen to go with Panasonic, hoping that this problem does not recur.<br /><br />As are most owners, I am quite please with this camera. It fulfills my needs (a travel camera), is fun to get to know, and produces some nice photos.",8,7,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2

It seems to do everything from the humongous zoom lens to the extremely effective image stabilization.  Everything works as described.  My only disappointment is that there is not a way to mount a polarizing filter on it, but I don't think any compact camera has that option.  I love the WiFi capability.  Every picture I've taken so far has been sharp and correctly exposed.  It's slightly bigger than a &#34;pocket&#34; camera, but it still fits in your pocket.  What's not to like?",4,3,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5
Najma Debbarma,4,A good compromise,2015-02-15,Y,"There already many reviews with pros and cons, and I just received this camera 3 days ago so I am just going to provide first impressions.  Relatively compact and light.  Will make a shirt pocket sag but easily fit in a jacket pocket or a case to hang from your belt.  I want a camera which I can take hiking or long vacations without lugging around a DSLR.  I read all the reviews on Amazon for several similar model cameras, plus a bunch of camera review sites.  If you want something compact, with 20x+ zoom, there's limited selection.  You also have to compromise.  Some of those are determined by laws of physics, technology limitations, etc.  Basically you aren't going to get DSLR image quality out of something that is this small, but the quality you get today is probably equivalent to the DSLRs of a few years ago.  So the photos (from any tele compact) have issues if you are going to turn them into a poster or people blow them up as big as they can and pixel-peep at the corners, but will probably look fine in everyday use.  I mainly compared reviews for this and the Canon Powershot 700 and although the Canon seems to have a tiny edge overall in image quality, there are some places where the ZS40 is better.  I did do some pixel-peeping with photos I took outside but I didn't do a fair comparison so the quality issues I saw I wonder if it is like somebody saying they saw a flea in your house and suddenly you start itching.  I don't usually blow up my photos on the computer to full image size (which would be like turning them into a poster size print and viewing it from 2 feet away!)  In the end my decision was mostly based on other factors.  The ZS40 has a viewfinder (electronic) which helps if you take pictures in the sun where a LCD will be washed out.  You can also use your face to stabilize the camera which you will need with a 30x telephoto.  There's a lot of items that can be configured.  I like there are 4 programmable modes where you can save your own settingsfor quick access.  I don't like the charge the battery in the camera requirement, which stopped me from buying a Panasonic earlier, but I see you can get third party batteries and external chargers.  I consider this essential as I do all day hiking, and camping, and there isn't a place to charge every night.  I have had the camera turned on for about 3 hours each day for the last 2 days just learning the settings (GPS turned off) and it still dropped 2/3 charge in just that time.  I know I will definitely need at least one if not several spare batteries for 4 day back country camping trips.  Since I do not intend to charge batteries in the camera, and I transfer image files to my Mac using a card reader, I guess the whole proprietary USB connection issue is of less concern to me, as is temperamental wi-fi (which I don't use).  The buttons on the back are tiny, even if you have small hands like mine.  I don't know if the camera I got has an issue but I found when doing some settings it would suddenly jump from one selection to a different one. Maybe I have a tiny twitch in my finger but the dial sure is sensitive.  Oh, this model does not have the touch-screen of the earlier super zoom models.  I could see it being handy for faster and surer access of the menus but I can see trade-offs being necessary with the introduction of the viewfinder.  So I guess for me the camera is a keeper (unlike my Canon Powershot 280 which I returned because of battery level issues) (my 30 day return runs out when I am not going to be near anywhere I from where I could return it).  No it isn't perfect but it is probably 85-90% what I want (I would have given it a 4.5 star rating on what I have seen so far) and nothing else would rate quite that high.  As I said earlier, it a matter of compromises.  Edit Feb. 16, 2015: I see the ZS50 has just gone on sale. 1) No GPS but GPS eats batteries and I have limited use for it.  2) Better viewfinder but old one isn't bad.  3) 12MP resolution instead of 18.  People have claimed 18 is excessive and just adds noise to the pictures.  12 is quite a dropdown but I wonder if it takes better pictures because of it?  Edit June 2015: Knocking off a star.  Good pictures under normal conditions but disappointing when getting more demanding (which I do a lot).  1) Really hard to get anything decent in low light (I can do better with my 5 year old, cheaper Canon 1300 is). There are several modes supposedly for doing that but I never got good photos of stars (there is even a star mode), or floodlit buildings at night. 2) Multi-exposure HDR correction seems very marginal.  I can't tell the difference and it slows down the camera a lot.  3) Can't set to take 35mm film format pictures when in full iA auto mode.  Widescreen format is okay for some things but a portrait mode photo is awfully thin.  4) White balance can be very off at times. I took photos in a very lush, vivid green forest and the camera display was showing everything as pale grayish-green.  I spent ages trying every white balance adjustment method including taking a picture of a piece of paper and setting it manually.  Oh, I could color correct on my computer but I should not have to do that with thousands of photos taken on a trip to New Zealand.  On another occasion I was taking photos of jellyfish in a large aquarium lit purely by changing LED lights. Even if they were in pure blue light it came up as orange yellow in the picture even trying every color light source setting available. And forget about getting any decent light metering in that situation.  Even with point metering every single Panasonic photo came up blurred. Again I have much better pictures from my 5 year old, much cheaper Canon 1300is.  Edit August 2016: I recently found if I took a picture of solid blue sky there was smudging near one edge of the photo caused by dust on the sensor. This can happen with any super telephoto point and shoot due to air being sucked into the camera when extending the lens but it seem Panasonics are particularly prone to this. I asked about getting the camera cleaned and it would cost as much as this camera is now worth! If this happens to you there are take-apart videos online but it is a delicate procedure. There is also a vacuum-cleaner method which I have not tried (yet) which can fix it -- or make it worse.  Right now I only notice the smudge with a light, solid area in the photo so it isn't noticeable in 99% of the photos I take and I am leaving it for the time being.",3,3,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,4

rad25,3,Good but not as great as I had hoped.,2015-02-08,Y,As an avid advanced amateur (I have 6 DSLR's and countless point and shoots) I was looking forward to checking out this super zoom compact.<br /><br />I was impressed by several aspects - great size and weight. A balanced feel. Zoom controls are easy to use when shooting. Front control wheel around lens that is programmable is also a plus. Video image quality is pretty impressive. Good colors and very manageable.<br /><br />Things I did not like:<br />1- Image quality in less than daylight is poor to horrible. The flash certainly helps. But indoor shoots where normally the flash will not fire the amount of graininess is unacceptable.<br />2- The location of the flash is often obscured by my finger - I see others with this camera having the same issue so it is not just my big hands.<br />3- The location of the off button - I am constantly starting the video instead of shutting down the camera. Not the cameras fault I guess but some differentiation in this location would have helped.<br />4- image quality at full optical zoom is sub par. I would certainly expect better - even from a point and shoot. This is after all a reasonably pricy point and shoot.<br />5- camera is claimed to have a high speed shooting mode though I have a tough time catching more than a shot per second.

These scratches were 1-2 mm and only a few no where near the lens. Because of the scratches they say it invalidated the warranty.

Pranitha,4,Excellent Travel Zoom may not have the Quality of the Japanese made Predecessors,2015-01-17,Y,"The ZS40 (TZ60) is a replacement for my TZ5.  Only had it a week but I am pleased so far.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Nice feel of the rubberized coating<br />- The existence of a viewfinder is a HUGE plus in small cameras -- often used on snow or in bright sunlight where the old screen-only models were hamstrung.<br />- Still pocketable size though a little (1/2 inch) longer than my beloved TZ5.<br />- The big zoom range quoted as being 30X optical zoom is staggering.  Put on your 35mm pre-1995 mind set and think of this. Wild.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Made in China instead of Japan. I am skeptical of the relative quality. The fit and finish show negatively and it simply looks cheaper than my TZ5. The apparently plastic body is inferior to the metal body of the TZ5.<br />- Appearance: I made the mistake of buying the silver model. The \\""silver\\"" part looks like a thin coat of spray paint rather than looking like machined aluminum.  Don't pay a dime extra for the silver version. It simply reveals cheap construction.<br />- Batteries: There is no excuse in this world why the TZ5, my wife's TZ6 and this TZ60 were not designed to take interchangeable batteries!  Spares, chargers, all of that -- just foolish that they are not interchangeable.<br />- Some features are just a bewildering mess to set up and use. They are of course the inherently complex ones like focusing on the butt of some duck running around and how to hold that spot in focus. Largely obscure features in other words.<br />- The umpteen functions that can be assigned to the ftn button are impressive but never going to be used by the average buyer who will NEVER remember what he assigned to that button.<br />- I have yet to decode the GPS data from this thing. I've seen at least 2 differing formats -- none of which are explained in the manual on paper or the one on the CD. The GPS lat/long data is hosed up (no doubt due to user ignorance) but the instructions in the manuals do NOT unravel the issues at all.  Somebody tell me what  38;  18;  40.42000000 means in GPS results regardless of whether it is latitude or longitude. Then try 76;  28;  30.47999999 .  Then try 17056881; 51; 12.1500015 ... with  the three dots afterward being permanent in the properties details box and no way to expand them. No explanation anywhere.<br /><br />[The GPS data was later interpreted for me by another user. All good. They should provide such interpretation and examples n the manuals.]1/21/15 jwr<br /><br />Comments:<br />- I like the push-button on/off switch just fine. Other reviewers complained of that and I don't agree. Does not catch on the pocket contents and inadvertently turn on the camera. Good.<br />- It feels flimsy compared to the TZ5 but that is very subjective and may be meaningless.<br />- The aperture and shutter priority modes are easy to set, easy to use and very intuitive. Better than about any camera I have used. Harks back to some really good 35mm models of yesteryear.<br />- The control ring and the control dial are very nice design features.<br />- The resulting jpeg images average around 6MB in size. Thank gawd storage is cheap and plentiful.<br />- The menus on this TZ60 are much better and less guessy than the old TZ5 -- more intuitive and self explanatory.<br />I must say I picked it up out of the box and was able to setup all features and use the camera immediately based on transfer of learning from the TZ5.

Charu,5,Excellent camera and photos. Everything you need in a compact unit.,2015-01-16,Y,"Oooooh boy! Might nice camera. Traded in a Panasonic FZ150 to put money towards this model. So glad I did. Had purchased FZ150 to take to Iceland to photograph Northern Lights. Did a fine job but the camera is a bulky SLR style body. Bought this DMZ-ZS40K for a recent trip to Disneyworld. I wanted something that would fit in my pocket and this fit the need perfectly. It is a small camera. Just bordering too small for my big hands. The photo quality is beautiful. All the features are listed in the description so I will not repeat them. Just realise this is a feature rich camera. Offers everything the FZ150 offered but in a smaller package, longer zoom and unusual flr almost any point-and-shoot today, a viewfinder! Also the photos are much better than rhe FZ150. I purchased 2 extra batteries and an external battery charger. Let's put it this way, seven days in Disney, 840+ photos taken and never switched out the battery. All I did was charge the camera while sleeping at night and it was good all day. This was almost exclusively using the electronic viewfinder, not the big screen on the back. Even then I'd expect good battery life. A viewfinder adds so much to taking good pictures. Number one, it's indespensible in the sunlight. Number two, when holding the camera to your eye it gives stability.",11,11,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,3
Amazon Customer,4,"Great camera, possible software incompatibility with Kaspersky Internet Security",2015-01-14,Y,"I like the camera very much, it handles well, takes great images, and has an incredible zoom range. The electronic viewfinder is very useful in bright light.<br /><br />However I had serious Windows problems after installing the companion software, PhotoFunStudio 9.3 PE which took a whole day to fix. After restarting Windows 8.1 after installation, the desktop was non-responsive and Windows became unusable, I could only switch off the PC by removing power. After that, Windows would only run in safe mode. Doing a System Restore (twice) had no effect.<br /><br />After some investigation this turned out to be an issue with Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 (anti-virus software), which seemingly decided to prevent any program from running, even Ctrl-Alt-Delete would not launch Task Manager.  Given that this happened right after installing PhotoFunStudio it would seem there is an incompatibility.<br /><br />I may have just been unlucky, but if you have Kaspersky Internet Security you may want to back up all of your data first before installing PhotoFunStudio, just in case, or perhaps change your anti virus software.  I would have given 5 stars but because of the software issues I've dropped it to 4.",0,0,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2
Boopathi,5,A CAMERA WITH EXCELLENT FORM AND FUNCTION,2015-01-13,Y,When I think of devices that are engineered with the user in mind my first thoughts always go to Apple and their excellent array of products.

It will take panorama photo's too. I like the way the front wheel is multifunction I use it mainly for zoom setting. have to explore the other functions. I don't have a smart phone so this is my go everywhere camera. for use when I don't have my Olympus and lenses with me. I have to say this takes some high quality pictures. It doesn't come with a battery charger so I bought the wasabi two battery and charger kit. means I carry the camera all the time it's not hooked up for a couple of hours charging the battery of a usb port.

Lakshmi,5,Very good point and shoot with 30X zoom,2015-01-06,Y,"After a few weeks of use, I am pleased with the camera.  I have had two previous LUMIX cameras so the learning curve was minimal.  The speed is good, the width of the lens is great and it takes clear pictures, like any point and shoot, it struggles with high ISOs.  Love the 30X zoom.  Works quickly and the pictures are clear.  Also like the glass through scene feature as I take a lot of bird picture from inside the house.  One feature that has been omitted with this camera is the 2 second timer.  I used it to avoid the jerk on the shutter release button.  Overall,  very good point and shoot that still fits In a pocket. I haven't used all the features yet nor have I been successful hooking it up to wifi.

Prince,2,"Disappointing image quality, especially from flash",2015-01-05,Y,"Okay, admittedly I've been spoiled by using Sony cameras (NEX6, RX10, etc.), so I knew this product would not produce image quality as good as those products, but what I WASN'T expecting was the really awful image quality from using the &#34;flash&#34; on this Panasonic product.  While dining with friends in a restaurant I took a few pics using the built-in flash.  The quality was so lousy and I was so disappointed by the photos today I returned the camera.  If you're into faces that look like something you'd find in Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum as opposed to, well, REAL human beings, then this is the camera for you.  Also, it is very easy to partially cover the flash with your finger while taking a photo, so watch out for that.<br /><br />In addition to disappointing image quality, I spent a couple frustrating, unsuccessful hours trying to get the useless wifi feature from this camera to work with my PC.  While I WAS able to transfer photos to my Samsung S4 smartphone via WiFi, I never could make the ZS40 to upload photos to my computer via my network router.  Geesh!  By the way, the image quality from my S4 smartphone is superior to the image quality from this &#34;camera.&#34;  The one redeeming feature of this ZS40 is that it offers a small, but useful EVF.  Other than that I was very unimpressed....",3,1,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2

Abhishek,3,Don't buy this for the wi-fi,2015-01-02,Y,"One of the main reasons I bought this camera is because it has wi-fi.  I wanted a way to wirelessly transfer photos to my PC instead of having to use a USB cable.  Well, the wi-fi on this phone is not ready for prime time.  The PC connections REQUIRES you to have a Windows password, even though I'd prefer not to have one on my computer.  It loses the connection frequently.  The transfer rate to the PC is painfully slow, almost a full minute per picture.  To transfer multiple photos, you have to select each one individually--there's no option to select all.  The PDF manual is woefully unspecific and unhelpful.  Technical support at Panasonic is not well-versed in wi-fi problems.",3,3,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,1

Sadik wani,4,I Am Smiling,2014-12-23,Y,"It arrived today and I have spent more than four hours using it and learning about its controls/settings as I have to take photos for a family Christmas party in two days. I had a strong reaction to my first photo in low light, a BIG POSITIVE! After a hundred photos under all types of conditions and settings today , I believe this was a wonderful choice in cameras. It's size is perfect for me to carry conveniently; the zoom length is important to me and at the longer distances with a tripod it's very good; its videos are rated by me as good but I am really going to use it for slow motion only. It's build seems excellent, very sturdy. The only real competition it had before my purchase was from the Olympus Stylus which costs $300 more. If I replace this camera I am certain the replacement will have big, new features which will be the reason to leave this camera such one of the larger sensors available today as their prices descend and with a resolution of 4K. I assume with price drops that maybe in 18 months and maybe I will be sorely tempted to move up in capabilities. But until then, COLOR ME HAPPY!",2,2,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5

Gaurav bhushan,5,Great small travel camera,2014-12-16,Y,"I only have the camera a short time, but so far I am very happy with it. Purchased it as a &#34;throw in the purse&#34; camera, as carrying my mirrorless camera with lenses or DSLR just isn't always warranted, but I often miss a camera when I don't bring one. I used a borrowed zs20 on a trip to Peru when my Samsung NX300 died, and loved the panoramic feature and great zoom. The superzoom on this camera is amazing. Just took it to try out on the beach and caught some great shots of birds without scaring them away (see the one legged bird in the attached). Color seems great. I could see taking this as the only camera on a trip. A recent photo enthusiast, so I can't address all of the technical issues, and haven't tried the macro feature etc., so cannot comment on all modes,  but for someone who wants a reasonably small camera with a lot of features, I recommend this one. Has all of the modes available, Aperature and Shutter priority, Auto, Program and Manual, as well as tons of &#34;scene&#34; modes. Range of settings more limited than my other cameras, but this isn't the same type of camera. I am returning the DMC ZS35 I first purchased (20X zoom), because this one has an EVF (hate fighting the washed out display on a sunny day when there is no EVF) and 30X zoom. It was worth the extra money. Purchased used from Amazon warehouse, so happy with the price.",9,9,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,5

Amazon Customer,3,I loved the features on this camera. I did not love the quality of the images. I ended up selling it after 6 months.,2014-12-07,Y,"I owned a previous version of this camera, the DMC-ZS3. I used and loved this camera for many years, and took it all over the world. One day last year, I stupidly left it sitting with the lens open on a table, not realizing it was pointing at the sun. It burned out some of the pixels on the image sensor, and every picture I took after that had a dark area in it. Time for a new camera.<br /><br />I did a ton of research. I wanted a smallish superzoom camera, with excellent picture quality, a good flash, good low light capabilities, GPS, stereo mics for recording video, and at least as many features as my old ZS3. This camera was not yet available, but the reviews on it seemed to be universally great. When it became available, I bought it immediately.<br /><br />I was at first overwhelmed with the features, but once I got my head around it, it was amazing. The NFC-based WiFi was cool: I could tap my Android phone against the camera, it would automatically connect, start the Lumix app on the phone, and I could then control the camera from my phone and transfer pictures to it. I used this feature to take many pictures with me in it, triggering the camera remotely using my phone.<br /><br />I set up the Wifi to hook up to my network at home, so that every time the camera was plugged in to charge, it automatically connected to my Wifi network and transferred all new pictures and videos to my computer. No more removing memory cards and manually copying pictures!<br /><br />I took quite a few panoramic pictures - you just push the shutter button, swoop the camera around and it automatically took pictures and stitched them together seamlessly. This is something that used to take hours to do manually, now the camera does it for you without any effort!<br /><br />The optical zoom was beyond amazing, and with its optical image stabilization, it was possible to use it at full zoom as a handheld, without a tripod - and without reducing the resolution of the pictures!<br /><br />All of these things are fantastic, they worked, and were easy to use. I loved the features!<br /><br />But after six months with the camera, I sold it. Why?<br /><br />Despite having all kinds of fantastic whizz-bang features that do incredible things, the quality of the pictures it took were sub-par. In fact, the pictures taken by my five-year-old DMC-ZS3 were of better quality, even though it was only a 10 MP camera, and this one has an 18 MP sensor. The contrast on this camera was poor, saturation was not great, and the low-light performance of this camera was simply atrocious - with a ton of noise. Taking pictures with this camera in dimly lit rooms, or in low light situations where the subject was beyond the range of the flash was simply not possible. I tried everything I could do - manual aperture and shutter speeds, adjusting the maximum ISO, every setting I could work with - but it became apparent that the problem was in fact the image sensor itself. Packing 18 million pixels into a tiny sensor means each of those pixels receives less light. There's only so much you can do with image processing after the fact - if the sensor isn't recording the image, you can't rescue it after the fact. To say I was supremely disappointed was an understatement.<br /><br />The video in bright daylight was quite good, if not a bit soft - I would have liked to have seen a bit more sharp images. An example of video taken with this camera in bright light:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAIPHTwcNY<br /><br />I was also extremely disappointed in the noisy video taken when subjects were not extremely brightly lit - and sometimes when they were! Often the camera would adjust for one object in the frame that was very bright, leaving the rest of the frame dark and noisy. My attempts to take video of stage performances were dismal, as it would repeatedly lose focus in the dark, taking seconds to recover. An example I of video I took in low light, showing the focus problems:<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrslbFjwP3U<br /><br />The final straw was when I got a new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 smartphone. It, being a smart phone, has a simple camera with an simple LED flash. I started finding that the pictures taken by my phone were in fact often of a better quality than the pictures taken by this camera!<br /><br />It was time to cut my losses and move on from this camera. I sold it on eBay (surprisingly for $25 less than you can buy new) and bought a Nikon D5300 DSLR instead. It's not as portable or as easy to carry around as this Panasonic, but it does make spectacular pictures.",17,16,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2

Seema k.,3,I like this camera for its small size,2014-12-03,Y,"I like this camera for its small size, sharp image quality, and versatility. I don't like it for the fact it is Chinese made, is designed so that you almost cannot avoid covering the flash when you are shooting night shots, and the Wi-Fi pairing is much more complicated than it needs to be. I had my Nikon D3200 with Wi-Fi module sharing photos with my iPad within five minutes. I have been working on pairing this camera for two days.I also think that the control buttons on the back could be made 30% larger. I believe this is a well-made camera. But, I always gravitate toward Japanese-made products. My much less expensive Panasonic Lumix TZ-19 (less than half the price) is Japanese made. Truthfully, I believe this is a great camera for a techie with small hands. But, I will likely return it because I just don't believe I can ever get totally comfortable with it. I will probably opt for a similarly priced Canon G16 (made in Japan) or a Nikon B7800, even though it is also built in China.",7,5,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,6

Ravi,4,One of the best slim and pocketable compacts around at present.,2014-12-01,N,"Being new to this 'semi-serious hobby photography' game, I would make a few points about the current 'buying the new camera' game.<br /><br />INTRODUCTORY POINTS:<br /><br />1. It's an ultra competitive environment. This means there are some truly great camera deals around, as well as some rubbish propaganda out there.<br /><br />Camera makers are very market-oriented, meaning they sometimes sacrifice quality for hype, and if you know a few things first, you can get around the bells and whistles and various marketing hype out there and get a really good quality functional and picture quality camera at not a very high price. This is one of those (The ZS40 in the US is also the TZ60 in Australia).<br /><br />2. Opinions of 'expert reviews' are just that, opinions.<br /><br />Everybody feels differently about specifics because some things which are very important to one person are completely irrelevant to another. To get a few points off my chest straight away:<br /><br />Non negotiable point 1:<br />I absolutely HAVE to have either a telescopic lens or a superzoom lens, otherwise I don't want to take pictures, it's as simple as that. I've found it needs to be at least 20x. I don't want to go searching and resizing the image for that distant bird in the trees or that funny advertising sign in the distance, or that surfer in the distance, back on my laptop later, I want a close up ON my viewscreen at the time, so I can compose and take the distant shot the way I want it. This rules out a lot of otherwise very good cameras straight away, e.g. the Sony RX100 series, the Canon G7, Panasonic Lumix LX100 etc.<br /><br />Non negotiable point 2:<br />Another camera type I don't see any point whatsoever pursuing is a camera without an electronic viewfinder (EVF), I want to compose and take the shot carefully, not on an LCD screen which I struggle to focus on and hold in the wind, or on rocking boats, or in sunshine etc. Yet many 'expert reviews' don't even bother mentioning whether a camera has an EVF. Sorry, for me it's a non-negotiable issue. (So much for another bunch of otherwise good cameras, such as the Olympus SH1, Canon SX700 etc) .<br /><br />Non negotiable point 3:<br />Must fit in my pocket, if I am paying less than $1000. Sorry, I want to walk around Europe or the Himalayas with my wallet, passport, and camera, all in my pockets, with my hands completely free to read that book in the shop, or eat a sandwich, or ride a bike, or scratch my nose, or tip that dodgy official or haggle with that shop owner without them noticing my camera. I take the camera out in a few seconds when I see something, it's as simple as that. I don't want it swaying down into my soup either from around my neck.<br /><br />For others, they have to have things like WIFI, or panaroma, or touchscreen, or 7 different lenses, and so on. 'Experts reviews' sometimes don't even mention the things I mentioned above, so I just ignore these expert reviews.<br /><br />Make the points you want in a camera first, and then buy THAT camera, ignore the sales agents who want to tell you that the best camera in the world doesn't even have an EVF or needs a superzoom that you cant put in your pocket or 11 lenses. It's their opinion, not yours.<br /><br />Now the Lumix TZ60/ZS40 (its called a TZ60 in Australia where I'm from).<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />Great functionality.<br />Big zoom (30x, with 2x digital, meaning its really 30x and cropped), BUT STILL THIN ENOUGH TO FIT IN POCKET. A big plus.<br />Very superior lens ( I imagine the lens alone would cost something around $400, so you are getting a Leica deal teamed up with a very good Panasonic camera for much less than either bought alone-this is that cut throat market out there working for you, and this camera takes full advantage of it.)<br />'Intelligent auto' feature is better than picking the scene yourself.<br />Great new starry sky feature. Put it in a makeshift holder or a tripod for star pictures at night.<br />Good macro (3 cm-better than the Sonxy HX60 for example)<br />Sepia, and black and white option, as well as one colour option (as In Schindler's List's red girl)<br />Wifi, Panaroma, 3D pictures, slow motion video, and all the other bells and whistles, if you use them.<br />Good image stabilisation I'm told, and good and fast autofocus and tracking,<br />FULL HD video (1080).<br />It's weather-sealed if you get it too wet (not all cameras are, but don't put it fully underwater).<br />Built in EVF (not super high quality in terms of pixels etc, but for me it certainly does the job, and it has to be built-in or pop up to fit in your pocket, external attachments are too fiddly and no good for a compact-defeats the point and shoot purpose).<br />Very good picture quality for this price.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />There is no touch screen, which I suspect all cameras will have in a few years, it's just a question of time and price, so the next ones I get will be touch screen.<br />At 30x distance the focusing is a little more difficult, as the camera starts to struggle to focus at 30x, which is also why you don't get better quality cameras with superzooms on them, after this 'at-cheaper' price they all start to become interchangeable lenses if you want big zooms. At 20-25x its still fine, I've found its only at the very end of 30x it starts to struggle to focus.<br />No external charger. Not a big deal with me, I charge it in the wall via the cable or in my laptop.

Sensor sizes and specifics are deliberately obscure and vague, either because the camera companies are hiding things from you, or the 'expert reviewers' are. Sensor size, together with resolution and pixels are key factors in picture quality and in buying any camera,  (and I still don't get how all these various factors come together, primarily because companies are deliberately vague about it).<br /><br />I have a Sony A7 full frame (around $1500) camera which has a 36x24 sensor, which is a way bigger sensor, and on testing I find that the quality is, surprisingly, not that different between the Sony A7 and this Panasonic TZ60/ZS40, I suspect because the newer sensors in compacts are getting better and better, and also I suspect because I need a $1000-2000 lens to bring out the full quality of my full frame Sony A7, which I am in the process of getting, but still, the TZ60 pictures are really not that bad at all in comparison. (E.g. blades of grass, foliage, individual hairs on my cat, brightness and all-round reliability).<br /><br />Haven't tried the video yet. It's 1080 full HD.<br /><br />VERSATILITY AND OTHER CAMERAS:<br /><br />And also, I, like many, am going down the track of having 1 pricier camera (full frame) -my Sony A7 $1500 mirrorless (because I just don't like the bulkiness of the DSLRs)- and with a superior pricey lens that I look after and take time with and fuss over, and then a throw-around compact camera for everyday shots at A LOT LESS the price-which is the TZ60/ZS40 at around $400-500. The two together have the all round features I need in smaller version cameras (oh, and the Olympus waterproof TG3 for surfing and swimming, but that's a specific-oriented toy, you could also go the GoPro in this category). The reason for people having 2-4 cameras, incidentally is that no camera in the world has ALLthese features together at affordable prices, (also you might lose, borrow to someone, or break one whilst travelling etc anyway).<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS:<br /><br />Very good camera.<br /><br />Get this if you need an EVF and a superzoom that is also thin and fits in your pocket, otherwise the Sony HX60 (if you don't need an EVF), or the Sony RX100 series3 or Olympus Stylus 1 or Panasonic Lumix LX100, OR Canon G7 (if you don't need a superzoom but these are a bit more), or the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ70 or many others if you want a bigger 50-60x superzoom style but note these DON'T fit in your pocket (which is why I didn't get one), or a DSLR (say a Nikon D3300, but again these are a little more pricey, the Canon 5DMK3 and Nikon D4 are super pricey and super bulky and heavy) if you don't want to put it your pocket, or the Olympus OMD or the Sony A7 series (if you want to pay more and get something better quality but a little thicker again, and with better interchangeable lenses, but with the lenses attached they aren't really pocketable but are still smaller and more travel friendly than the DSLRs), and the Olympus TG3 if you want a similar priced underwater -waterproof, (which I also have, but the pictures and video are not the same quality).<br /><br />Note: experts might find some of the above technically weak, as I am just a learning amateur, but that is how this game is played, not everyone who buys on the market knows everything about cameras, but they do tend to know what they LIKE in a camera (e.g. superzoom or not, EVF or not, touch screen, thin etc etc), and that is what this review is about.cause the camera companies are hiding things from you, or the 'expert reviewers' are.

archana,3,Hated it at first,2014-12-01,Y,"I've had it for several months now, so am getting used to it. Hated it at first.  It is a great size for travel.  Don't like the location of the viewfinder.  It is too far to the left. The on-off button is too small.  You need sharp fingernails to activate it.  Have had fun with some of the features, especially the star filter and panorama.  Have no use for the WiFi and it annoys me that the button for it is so close to the button for reviewing photos.  I often hit to accidentally and then don't know how to turn it off without turning off the whole camera.  Hitting the button again doesn't do it.  Have yet to figure out how to download videos.  I can watch them on the camera, but my computer doesn't seem to recognize them.  Will have to do more research on this.",3,3,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,2
shivsankar,5,I own a digital SLR (Nikon) with a variety of useful and expensive lenses but with a trip overseas coming ...,2014-11-30,Y,"I bought this camera as a replacement for the Lumix ZS7 that I have used in the past.  I own a digital SLR (Nikon) with a variety of useful and expensive lenses but with a trip overseas coming up soon, I decided that I would rather find the perfect \\""travel\\"" camera to take along that would weigh less and be more convenient.  Then I discovered the ZS40 as a replacement for the ZS7 and it is perfect for my needs. It has an incredible 30x zoom with image stabilization, an optical viewfinder which is very useful in bright conditions, GPS which I already had in the previous Lumix, and Wifi which is very helpful in transferring pictures to your phone or IPad.  The image quality is excellent and certainly not an issue for routine 4x6 or 5x7 photographs.  I like the versatility of using automatic features or composing your own with aperture or shutter speed priority. I also appreciate the 18 megapixels placing it right at the top of available compact digital cameras.  It is easy to use and small enough to carry in your pocket or a small camera bag on my waist. I purchased the AC charger and 2 extra batteries so I can leave the GPS on all day and not worry about the battery running out.  I also recommend a protective shield for the screen which I purchased here on Amazon from Germany (better than most others) (4 x DISAGU Armor screen protector for Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS40 screen fracture protection film).  I won't be taking my heavy dSLR on this trip much to the dismay of my wife who wonders why I own one!

One of the best things about it for me is that it has a viewfinder. Very few, if any, cameras of this size have a built in viewfinder. Trying to use a LCD in daylight just doesn't work for me. Other features that I really appreciate are the GPS and the 24-720m zoom.",1,1,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,1
Himanshi chaubey,1,Serious defects in not retaining user settings after powered off and very inaccurate GPS needs to be manually shut off by user,2014-11-30,Y,"Overall the camera is excellent but I bought it to get the GPS and automatic geo tagging of the pictures. It is in terms of the GPS that this camera falls short. I have two Bluetooth GPS units I use with my DSLR cameras and a Nikon Coolpix AW120 point and shoot that has GPS. I wanted a P&S camera with GPS and with Shutter Priority and RAW file capture and this Panasonic is the only one with all three of these capabilities.<br /><br />The worst aspect of this camera which is unlike any digital camera I have owned or used is that it does not store user settings after the power is turned off. It reverts to Auto Flash and it reverts to JPG Fine when it is turned off. I want RAW files and bought this camera because it had RAW capture but I have to go into the settings each and every time I power on the camera or I find I have shot JPGs instead. I need to be able to get accurate color and adjust the white balance of the pictures and for this I need RAW.<br /><br />I will be giving this camera away as in real world use it does not provide RAW capture or accurate GPS geotagging.<br /><br />The problems with the GPS are three-fold. First it takes a very very long time for the camera's GPS to determine the location, as in 3-4 minutes. Second is that with the GPS functioned enabled it remains active and drains the camera battery even after the camera is shut off. So I need to turn on the camera, go to the menu to select enable GPS, wait 3-4 minutes for the GPS to acquire the location, take pictures, go back to the menu to turn off the GPS, and then shut down the camera. This makes the GPS aspect a pain to use. The only option is to carry along a couple of spare batteries for the camera and leave the GPS on during the day and remembering to disable the GPS before putting it away. Not a big deal though as spare batteries are tiny in size, weigh next to nothing, and sell for around $20. The last aspect though is the GPS accuracy. My other camera provide a GPS location that is accurate to within 10 feet while the Panasonic DMC-ZS40 camera is off by more than 100 feet. The GPS is so bad with the Lumix ZS40 camera that I do not bother to use it.<br /><br />The other aspects of the camera more than make up for the GPS. It is very fast and even shooting RAW there is no lag with this camera. The camera has an infra-red autofocus assist capability that is remarkably good. I took a test shot outdoors on my deck at night and I could not even see outside but the camera accurately focused and perfectly exposed the shot. I can see where this would be great for use indoors in dark buildings including cathedrals where lighting is often very dim.<br /><br />The camera also senses when a subject is too close to the camera and it switches automatically to macro mode. This is a very slick feature. I can see where when traveling and taking general shots of people and places and then wanting a closeup of a small item and then being able to take that shot and then continue with general shooting without missing a beat.<br /><br />The camera has a quick menu feature that is controlled by the dial wheel at the back and this makes it super fast to change a setting, like the shutter speed or color temp or focus mode. It is better than anything I have seen on any camera, compact or pro DSLR.<br /><br />The lens provides 30x zoom but the key feature is that it is 24mm at the wide end. It may not seem like a big deal but I have had P&S cameras that only went to 28mm and indoors that was often very limiting. The lens also has an integrated cap so the front element is protected when the camera is turned off. No cap to stash while shooting and nothing to get lost is a very nice feature.<br /><br />If you don't care about the GPS and don't mind shooting JPGs all the time then this is an OK camera, only overpriced by about 50%.e the Panasonic DMC-ZS40 camera is off by more than 100 feet.

Veljala agnivesh maharaj,5,The electronic viewfinder puts this compact in a class by itself!,2014-11-11,Y,"I was looking to upgrade my old-ish DMC-ZS3, and the DMC-ZS40 seemed the best from other reviews I read. For this class of camera, I could not be happier. This camera is by far the best pocketable camera I've ever used.<br /><br />It isn't fair to compare the images to a current generation DSLR (which I also have), but in the end, the pictures I've taken look just as good as the DSLR. I'm talking color correctness, exposure, contrast, and focus.. I don't usually blow up my images much (part of the fun of taking pictures for me is composing in the camera, not later - and the 30X lens is absolutely perfect for that), so I can't comment on that. But, when I carry a pocket camera, I want to take the picture, and not fuss with the details, and the iA mode of this camera is totally amazing. It consistently turns out great images.<br /><br />And, I'm old enough that my eyes don't focus like they used to. This means holding a little camera out in front trying to get the LCD screen in focus, hold the camera still, see the screen in the sun, etc., is really not all that great. So to me, the single deciding factor for this camera over similar cameras (including the ZS30) was the viewfinder. The resolution of the LVF is plenty, the diopter wheel makes it in focus, all the info is there and readable, I can see it in the sun, and the camera is steady. Wow - just like a real camera!<br /><br />So for me, the LVF absolutely makes this small camera easy to shoot with. I don't know of any other cameras in this size that has an equivalent feature. I've seen some reviews complaining about the viewfinder size, but I have no issues with that. Preset the diopter, shove up my glasses, and it provides a perfectly adequate image that shows exactly what is in the shot, and all the other informative setting info. When you have old eyes, it is a real treat to be back to looking through a view finder on small camera again.<br /><br />But I really believe this camera takes really good images fora camera with a small-ish sensor. After using it for a couple of trips, two of the really nice auto features are the HDR and handheld night images (really, the same thing). I took several images using both the auto HDR mode and normal P programmable mode. The auto HDR was always a better image - and equally in focus. The night images are like magic - no tripod necessary.<br /><br />The video is also great. This camera has better slow motion options of any similar cameras I was able to find specs for.<br /><br />So, when I want a camera that fits my pocket and lets me be a lazy photographer when I want to (I compose the picture, it handles the exposure and focus), this camera is, for the moment, in a class by itself.<br />Pros:<br />+ LVF viewfinder<br />+ 30x zoom<br />+ auto modes - especially HDR<br />+ excellent image quality<br />+ all manual options you could want<br />+ multi-purpose lens ring - focus, zoom, whatever is natural<br />+ decent battery life<br />+ fast turn on to ready to shoot<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Just a little large - could slide into my pocked a bit more easily<br />- Stupid proprietary USB connector used for charging (get an external charger!) Why did they have to use a non-standard USB connector? Totally absurd.<br />- Auto focus slow at high zoom (maybe 20x and up, but it is easy to switch to manual focus)<br />- Almost too many options - a bit of a learning curve to use all the features effectively.<br /><br />If you want a camera that fits in your pocket, take pictures way better than your cell phone or one of those cheap $150 cameras, this one deserves your serious consideration. This class of camera is the perfect step between a cell phone and a big DSLR.<br /><br />The attached image has been resized and jpeg compressed (plus likely additional squeezing by Amazon), but otherwise has had no post image processing.",44,43,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,1

Ruhi siddiquee,2,Great specifications. Poor performance.,2014-11-01,Y,"Oh dear! Someone tell me if there is really such a thing as a compact digital that is easy to use AND produces great pictures AND is affordable.  Seems like there are always &#34;gotchas!&#34;. I bought this camera for 3 main reasons: First, it has the long range zoom lens, which should make it useful in many diverse conditions, right? Second, it has really advanced image stabilization, with accelerometers, and optical element adjusters, and all kinds of hi-tech components, so for people like me whose hands shake, picture quality should be better, and videos should be smoother. Third, it has an eye level viewfinder, also very useful for people whose hands shake, because holding the camera against your eye provides extra support and stability, right?<br />Well ... yes and no. First, the camera is difficult if not impossible to hold without accidentally pressing some control and spoiling your settings.  There are a couple of rubber grips, but they are very tiny and not really helpful.  I have to say, this is a problem with compact cameras in general, not just this one.  My well-meaning friend said &#34;Use a pistol grip.&#34; Well fine, except there is nowhere on this camera to attach a remote shutter release, either mechanical or electrical, so the trigger on a pistol grip is useless, making the grip useless. OK, there IS a way to remotely control the shutter, and that is via a wi-fi connection between the camera and your smartphone.  Let me see if I understand: I'm supposed to somehow hold a camera in one hand AND a smartphone in the other, and look at the camera screen while simultaneously looking at the phone screen to find the little &#34;shutter&#34; control, while hassling with all the camera settings, plus all the wi-fi settings, plus all the phone settings, plus two sets of meaningless beeps and cryptic screen messages?  Oh yes ... and two sets of batteries to keep charged.  Whatever happened to &#34;point and shoot?&#34;<br />Now, about that viewfinder. Youdon't need me to tell you how tiny it is. Virtually every other reviewer has complained about this.  If you wear glasses like me, I think it is extremely difficult to use. But let me tell you about the diopter adjustment. It might actually work ... I don't know... because it is so incredibly tiny and recessed that you virtually need a toothpick to adjust it.  I could find no way to adjust it with the camera to my eye.  As a result I was never able to get the viewfinder properly focused, and could therefore never use it to determine if my image was in focus. Of course, that meant I could never use it at all.  Now OK, I'm big and clumsy, so perhaps it was just me.  However my wife is tiny, petite and delicate, and she couldn't use it either.<br />What about the image stabilization? Well don't expect miracles, from Panasonic or any other camera I guess. If you are trying to take hand held shots at full telephoto, you are going to get shake even if you have the steadiest hands in the world. That said, I have to admit, it is extremely effective at ironing out jitter and bumps in videos.  It's not a full-fledged &#34;Steadicam&#34; by any means. Panasonic claims that it gives &#34;5-axis&#34; stabilization, whatever that means, but it is not as good as most 3-axis gimbals. That's not really the point though, because Steadicams and gimbals are large external steadying devices, whereas with this camera, it is all built in. I tried sitting the camera on the dashboard of my car and just driving around shooting video.  The results were pretty smooth. Walking shots didn't look so good however. I guess when I walk I must be wobbling on the 6th axis (lol).<br />The zoom lens does indeed have a remarkable range. Toward the long telephoto end I found the photographs to look a lot softer especially around the edges. You will read positive reviews containing telephoto pictures of church steeples five miles away, where the image is bright and sharp.  All I can say is: I did NOT experience this ... with any combination of settings. Also the zoom control is tiny and fiddly.<br />Speaking of tiny and fiddly, it has the usual four-way &#34;joystick&#34; control on the back, with the usual rotating circular dial control around it.  The dial control can be used for virtually every function, including zooming, aperture, shutter, special effects, focus, etc. This would be great if it weren't for the fact that every time I tried to rotate the dial I ended up accidentally pressing it in a little bit, which activates the 4-way joystick, and completely messes up whatever adjustment you are trying to make. How are you supposed to rotate a flat circular bezel without pressing on it a little?  I guess that toothpick would come in handy again here. In passing I'd like to make one comment about the manual-focus capability. It's a great thing to have occasionally, if it works. The problem on this camera is - you have to turn the dial round and round like a maniac to alter the focus distance by any substantial amount.  Trying to do this without accidentally pressing in a little is an ergonomic impossibility.  I just gave up and had to rely on the autofocus for all shots. That (autofocus) system was less than reliable. It always worked eventually, but often it took a long time to come into focus, especially with telephoto shots. I got a lot of out-of-focus shots, even in bright light under relatively normal conditions.<br />Lastly ... image quality. This camera has an 18.1 megapixel sensor. That's a lot of pixels! Supercrisp! Right?  Wrong!  I was very disappointed with the images.  They were grainy and noisy with jagged edges, even at ISO-100.  I have a little 5 year old Canon pocket compact that cost only a quarter as much as this Lumix, and its images are far, far less noisy. It wasn't just the noise, it was the general &#34;look&#34; of the images.  They looked as if they were &#34;paint-by-numbers&#34; pictures, or impressionist paintings. The colors seem to be daubed on with a broad brush.  That, plus the colored confetti-like noise in both dark and light areas, are the two biggest drawbacks to this camera where I'm concerned.  I just can't think of a good use for the device: there seems to be a &#34;gotcha&#34; that spoils it no matter what kind of pictures you plan to take.",8,4,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,3
Rambabu Tejavath,2,"Fantastic Telephoto Video, Disappointing Indoor with Family",2014-10-31,Y,"I bought this camera to replace a Panasonic DMC-ZS19 that was an excellent camera but eventually malfunctioned.  The DMC-ZS40 did a fantastic job of telephoto videos.  When taking videos or stills of our grandson playing football, the image was crisp and the image stabilized very nicely.  Far exceeded expectations.  But when used indoors for family functions the camera was very disappointing, too slow to capture &#34;the moments&#34;, and too blurry.  I returned the camera.",5,2,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,6
Amazon Customer,5,No Regrets - this is the right camera for me,2014-10-31,N,"Don't read this review - go out there and buy the camera!<br /><br />Whoever design the Panasonic ZS40 had a brain!  He made a camera for himself, filling it with the features that any photographer would want.  Unlike the Canon SX700, Panasonic did NOT skimp on features that most of us want simply to knock a few dollars off the price tag.<br /><br />I had the chance to have hands-on experience with the Canon SX700, Nikon S9700, SONY HX50, and the Panasonic DMC-ZS40.  All are subcompact cameras with 30X optical zoom.  Each camera will take acceptable photos and if you already have one of these cameras, enjoy it.  None of these cameras is perfect but the Panasonic has some outstanding features and performs well enough to top my list.<br /><br />How I used this camera and my standard for excellence are at the end of this write up.  I know that you are most interested in Image Quality (IQ), so let's begin there.<br /><br />Image Quality  Generally excellent and better than the other cameras mentioned above.<br /><br />- Macro photography - dead on, razor sharp images<br /><br />- Closely zoomed subjects, using about 10X zoom or less - good.  Good edge definition, no spongy water-color type blur.  I think that Nikon S9700 does as good and Sony HX50 does noticeably worse.  Panasonic did better than Sony at getting the exposure correct - Sony photos tended to be a bit too light.<br /><br />- Longer zoomed shots, (photos taken at or near 30X) - There was, at times, a detriment in image quality.  This is true for all cameras - at longer focal lengths, there is less light entering the camera and hence, less resolution.  However, most of my long-zoomed shots are excellent, with good edge definition,  and pleasing to look at even on the large-screened TV.<br /><br />- Cloudy days/Shaded areas - image quality ranged from excellent to a bit soft. However, Image Quality was as good or better than the other cameras<br /><br />In poorly lit scenes, or in scenes where there is high contrast between the brightest and darkest areas, the Panasonic takes several shots with a single push of the shutter button, then combine the shots to brighten the dark areas.  This works very well!<br /><br />Far away shots - a 30X photo of a subject just across the street will look better that a 30X photo of a subject a football field away - image quality deteriorates with increasing DISTANCE as well with increased ZOOM.  Panasonic still produced excellent photos at long distances.  Canon's IQ dropped off noticeably with increased distance.<br /><br />In general, both cropped and un-cropped photos display well when shown on a large screen HD TV<br /><br />Was every shot perfect?  Absolutely not.  There were numerous clunkers, just like with every other camera that I have owned.  However, I feel that I made the right decision in picking this camera for my trip abroad.<br /><br />Handling - excellent!!<br /><br />Unlike the Canon SX700, the designers actually put some thought where each dial and button should go.  The controls are logically placed and I never accidently hit the wrong button.  You can keep your eye in the viewfinder and your fingers intuitively go where they are meant to - good job, Panasonic.<br /><br />I think that SONY has the best menu system but Panasonics is not far behind.  For a camera loaded with features, it's easy to navigate the menus and get to where you want to.  In some ways Panasonic tops SONY because you can assign different functions to a dedicated (1) Function Button, to the (2) Back Wheel, and to the (3) Lens Ring.<br /><br />Start up times to the to take your first photo is nearly instantaneous - I never missed a shot because of a slow start up.  Shot-to-shot time is also decent.<br /><br />Image Stabilization - Excellent!<br /><br />At 30X, IS holds the camera rock steady.  I was impressed how well it works.  Unlike the Canon SX700 where the image dances the jitterbug once you zoom out, with the ZS40 you can forget about shake and concentrate on your photo.  Again, good job, Panasonic<br /><br />Night Photography - As with all cameras in this category, you can expect night photos to be softer, grainier.  Panasonic did a very good job here.  Panasonic offers FOUR night time scene modes.<br /><br />If you use a tripod, you will be delighted with the Night Tripod Scene in the Scene Mode.  Images are quite brilliant for a night shot.  The ISO jumped around from 100 to 800 depending on the ambient lighting (photos were taken downtown), but most shots were clean, edges well defined,  and ones you would want to share with friends.<br /><br />When you chose the Night Hand-held Scene mode, image quality drops off, as can be expected, but still the photos are very respectable.  The camera typically kept the ISO at 800 or less.  One photo was shot at ISO 6400 and, surprisingly, was NOT totally terrible.<br /><br />Panasonic takes multiple photos and combines them into a single photo, so photos come out brighter, showing more detail in areas that might otherwise be too dark.  Objects in the scene that emit light, such as a neon sign, may appear to &#34;wash out&#34;, that is, too bright because of the layering of multiple images.  This affects only the lit object, the rest of the photo is fine.<br /><br />There is a third night scene mode - for taking portraits in low light, and flash may be used.  A four night scene mode, Starry Night, allows for longer shutter speeds at two speeds, specifically 15 and 30 seconds.<br /><br />Digital Zoom - As a rule, I never shoot in digital zoom, but, in some modes/picture sizes combinations, there is no way to turn off the digital zoom.  I'd rather NOT see the digital zoom bar on the screen because then I run the risk of  accidently putting myself in digital zoom.<br /><br />However, for the purpose of this review, I did take several digital zoom photos.  Of course the images were softer, but, overall, they looked a lot better than I expected.  Panasonic's Intelligent Zoom is a big improvement from digital zoom photos of just two years ago<br /><br />At 115X digital zoom I was able to photograph and identify a Bald Eagle that was about 1000 feet away that I could not identify with a my Zeiss binoculars.  Even at 115X, the Image Stabilization kept the camera steady<br /><br />Extra Optical Zoom - does 30X = 36.7X  ???<br />If you select a smaller Picture Size, the optical zoom bar lengthens, and it appears that you can get extra optical zoom - such as 36.7X in Program Mode if you step down to 12MB.  I never saw this in other cameras.<br /><br />I called Panasonic and they confirmed that you &#34;gain&#34; optical zoom if you decrease Picture Size.  However, the girl on the phone couldn't tell me how to get rid of the Digital Zoom, so I don't know if she knew what she was talking about.  I don't see any negative difference in image quality when shooting 36.7X compared to 30X, but I don't have any technical way to measure this.<br /><br />Flash - I like that the flash is mounted on the front of the camera as opposed to popping up on top.  However, the placement of the flash may interfere with macro shots if the camera is too close to the subject.  Be careful not to place a finger from your  right hand over the flash.  Sadly, the flash itself is weak - the weakest I have seen any camera.  However, the Night Scene modes compensate for this to a large degree.  Also, sadly, there is no flash compensation adjustment.<br /><br />Other Features:<br /><br />Eye-level Viewfinder - Excellent!  I wear glasses and I can comfortably use this feature.  I got several shots of wildlife using this viewfinder which I would have missed otherwise.  I wish that this viewfinder was larger, even if it added a bit of width to the camera.  Otherwise, Good job, Panasonic!<br /><br />WiFi control of the camera - set up is a bit awkward, but I got it up and running.  I couldn't control the camera's zoom as smoothly I thought that I should.  However, I didn't try out the WiFi on the other cameras so I have nothing to compare it to.  I don't see myself using this feature very much.<br /><br />Lens Ring - neat idea for a small camera - I'm glad that Manual Focusing is on the dedicated ring on the front of the camera and not just a doubling of function of some other dial or button on the back.  You can also assign different functions to this ring.  When testing the sensor's sensitivity, I assigned ISO to this ring and it made switching from one ISO to another a snap.<br /><br />ISO - You know that Image Quality decreases as ISO increases, but you might be surprised how well the ZS40 does in this area.  There is not much of difference in Image Quality from ISO 100 to 200.  At ISO 400, there is a softening of image but probably would not be a problem for most people for general photography (buildings and other touristy sort of things).<br /><br />I skipped over the other ISO's, knowing that I would never use them, and jumped directly to ISO 3200.  ISO 3200 is noticeably worse but if you had to resort to that high an ISO, the results would be acceptable to an extent, and superior to the ISO 3200 results I found  in other cameras.<br /><br />Video - Well done, movies come out great.  The stabilization seems to be less steady than when shooting still photos, but not enough to be a problem.  High Speed Recording is in the Scene Mode and allows for slow motion playback.  With regular video, you can adjust the zoom as you take video but, strangely, not so in High Speed Recording.<br /><br />Panorama Shots - readily located on the main mode dial (not buried in a menu like on the Nikon), it's easy to use.  I love the &#34;clicking&#34; sound as each shot is taken.  The end result looks great - no visible seams.  Canon actually left the panorama feature off their camera (probably knocked a nickel off the price tag)<br /><br />Shoot-through-Glass - located in the Scene Mode - I congratulate Panasonic for including this mode.  I liketo shoot photos through hotel and airplanes windows.  This mode does NOT eliminate glare but helps the camera to focus beyond the glass onto your target.  In practice, it does make a difference, sometimes a lot, sometimes a little.  When I was on vacation, this feature saved photos that were otherwise impossible to capture.  Good going, Panasonic!<br /><br />Food Mode?<br /><br />Really?  However, photos of dinner plates taken in the Food Mode did &#34;pop&#34; when compared to the same photo taken in the Auto mode.  A gimmick for sure, but it works.  Perhaps  there are other applications for the Food Mode besides dinner plates.<br /><br />GPS - I don't use this.  I know where I have been and don't need to run the battery down needlessly.<br /><br />Battery Life - On vacation I got mixed results.  After about 180 photos, one bar (out of 3 bars) on the battery icon will go out.<br /><br />For the first two days of my vacation, the battery shut off after only 280 photos.  However, for the next two days, the battery lasted 320 photos.  In Venice, the battery lasted for 471 photos!  Who knows why?!<br /><br />On one day, I shot 1540 photos in the Rapid Shot Auto Focus mode and the battery bars did NOT go down.  It looked like I was still on full charge!  I can't explain this.<br /><br />Strap holders - there are two!!!! One on both sides of the camera. Both are deep to allow easy attachment and removal of the straps.  Having two holders allows the user to put the wrist strap where he wants it and , better yet, allows for a neck strap.  What a pleasure it was not to have to tie up my hands when I wasn't photographing.  Good job, Panasonic.<br /><br />Creative Scene Modes - This doesn't interest me.  This seems more of a gimmick.  Some of the &#34;creative shots&#34; are simply senseless.<br /><br />Custom Mode Button - easy to set up and I use this for night photography of insects.  You can have 4 custom settings, each easy to set up and access.  Canon offers NO customsettings (another nickel saved!)<br /><br />Play Back - in addition to all of the usual information, the screen even tells you what mode you used to shoot the photo!  I liked this.<br /><br />Customer Support - Powered by the Three Stooges<br /><br />- When I sign on for live help over the Internet, I had to specify my camera as well as the COLOR of my camera - does the color of the camera determine the what they can help me with?  Idiots!<br /><br />Later, when I later called customer support at Panasonic, the girl who answered my call kept asking me to hold while she relayed my question to some guy in the background.  She didn't seem to understand the answer but merely parroted it back to me.  When I asked WHY I can't turn the digital zoom off or WHY is the optical zoom goes above 30X, she didn't know.<br /><br />I realize that the person who answers the phone can't be familiar with every camera on the shelf, but just to say &#34;I don't know&#34; and leave it at that is pathetic.  She could have checked further into my questions and gotten back to me at a later time.  Disappointing, Panasonic.<br /><br />**************************<br /><br />Quirky stuff<br /><br />(1) Several times I left my camera in the Shoot-through-Glass mode When I turned the camera off.  When I powered up again, sometimes (1) the camera would go directly to the Shoot-through-Glass mode, (2) sometimes it would present the Scene Mode menu, and (3) sometimes it would go into High Speed video recording. This latter event happened several times and I found myself video-recording when I wanted to take a photo.  I don't know if I accidently hit a wrong series of buttons, but this was annoying.<br /><br />(2) The Night scene modes often takes multiple shots with one press of the shutter button.  This is usually great but can be a disaster when shooting a night shot out of the window of an airplane!  I got better out-of-airplane night shots with my old SONY HX9.<br /><br />(3) Shooting photos out of a moving vehicle (bus) is dicey at best, but the Panasonic seemed weak in this area.  Subjects that are too close come out as blurs and subjects too far away suffered in image quality.  In the past, I've done better with other cameras.  Shooting from an airplane in sunlight is not a problem - my photos of the Alps out of the plane window in the day light are right on the money.<br /><br />In all fairness, I have to play with the settings some more before I condemn Panasonic for #2 and #3 above.<br /><br />**************************<br /><br />My Standard of Quality:  after loading the photo on my 17 inch laptop screen, I then enlarge the image to 3X.  I expect good image quality at this level - sharp edges, no spongy watercolor-type blur, and, for birds and insects, razor-sharp eyes.  After I crop and light-adjust my photos, I often show them friends on a large screen HD TV and expect the same level of sharpness.<br /><br />So far, I have shot just under 8000 photos with the Panasonic in many conditions - sun, rain, clouds, indoors, evening, and night.<br /><br />I shot far away birds, and nearby insects, people, buildings, inside cathedrals, night photographs in town, mountain and beach scenes, and photos through glass windows (buses and airplanes).<br /><br />Pictures were typically shot at an ISO 100 except for photos where the ISO was picked by the camera (i.e. scene modes).  In one section above, I comment on the camera's performance  at selected ISO's.<br /><br />*************************************************<br /><br />Bob",90,87,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,4

Afrin Sultana,4,Tip for customizing the settings.,2014-10-03,Y,"There are a lot of reviews of this camera, so I thought I'd write one that covers things not covered much by other reviews.    1)  It does record high speed video, up to 240 fps in VGA resolution!  It can make a hummingbird's wings visible.  2)  It does wonderful panoramic shots.  You just pan the camera across the subject, and it records the panorama!  Awesome.  3)  I can take 30x zoom pics hand held, with no blur!  Wow.  4)  It does have full manual setting capability, but the iAuto function does a great job.  This makes it a wonderful camera for both beginners and photography hobbyists.  5)  The HDR functionality is a must.  Do not buy a camera without it.  It lets you evenly expose a backlit subject, as well as those landscape scenes with contrasting bright and shadow areas.  Absolutely wonderful feature.  6)  The previous version had a touch screen.  Seems like you'd be accidentally touching it too much while trying to take a picture.  I'm with the people who say it isn't necessary to have a touch screen.  7)  The viewfinder....not using it much.  It's nice to have it for those hand held zoom shots, though.  8)  It can store up to 4 sets of customized settings.  It stores 1 in the first (C1) position on the mode dial, while the second (C2) position can store 3 more that are accessible through the menu arrows.  See tip below for how to make great use of this.  9)  Great low light capability.  I'm impressed with how well it takes pictures in low light.  10) Pocketable.  Comfortable to carry in normal fitting pants pockets, though not a shirt pocket.  11)  The high speed burst mode is really good.  If you use a high enough shutter speed, you'll get very good still shots of sports and hummingbirds.    Why not 5 stars?  Well, it's not perfect.  Here's my complaints:    1)  You can't see the screen with polarized sunglasses on.  The screen goes black.  They could have polarized the screen 90 degrees off (like phones and gps screens), but they didn't.  2)  While you can change the functionality of each of the two rings, any change you make is propagated to all camera modes, except the 4 C modes.  For example, I'd like to set one of the rings to control ISO.  This would be great if each mode (auto, A, S, M, etc) could have unique functions set for these rings, but the function setting is universal.  Oddly, if you leave the ring functions set to default, then the functions will be unique to each mode.  For example,  the default setting for both rings in Aperture Mode is to control the Aperture, and the control the shutter speed in Shutter priority mode, while in iAuto mode, they both control the zoom.  I would like to make one of them control the ISO, but not when in full manual mode, because then one should control the aperture and the other should do the shutter, which is how it does work if you leave them set to their default functions.  However, if you have set one to control ISO, then it will always control ISO, not matter what mode you are in, making it really difficult to control both shutter and aperture in manual mode.  3)  The same problem exists if you change the function of the Fn button.  It applies across all modes.  4)  Wrist strap is grey on my black camera.  Should be color matched.  (not a big deal, but just saying)  5)  Included photo album/editing/organizing software is poor.  6)  Somewhat cantankerous and slow image viewing when in record mode.  I thought maybe this was due to my older memory card, but the speed problem goes away when in pure playback mode.  Wish they would fix this, because it'd be nice to not have to switch into playback mode to be able to quickly flip through your pictures.  As it is, it'll let you flip backward/forward through them when in record mode, but it's slow and clunky.    Tip for programming the rings and Fn button -  Thankfully, the programmed settings for the rings and Fn button will stay unique if saved in one of the four (C) settings.  I set up the camera the way I want it towork for full manual mode(large ring does shutter and small ring does aperture), and stored that in C1, which I now turn to for full manual.  I can store up to 4 of these customized settings, each with its own functionality for the rings and Fn button.  The other modes all get set to this... I set the large ring to control ISO, leaving the small back ring set to default control.  This lets the back ring control aperture, shutter, filter and scene settings as appropriate for each mode, while giving me quick access to ISO.  I also set the Fn to control the type of focus, giving me easy access to that.    Tip for improving the slow image viewing in record mode - it speeds up quite a bit if you format your memory card in the camera itself.  This erases any pics on your card, of course.      Tip for battery usage - be sure to turn off the GPS functionality when the camera isn't in use.  I was shocked that this runs the battery down in a couple of days of the camera being \\""off\\"".  The GPS regularly checks for signal, even when the camera is off, unless you turn GPS off.      If they could fix that polarized glasses issue, and let each mode have its own custom settings for the control rings and Fn button, I'd give this 5 stars.",44,44,Panasonic  Digital Camera with 3-Inch LCD,3

It has many other top of the line features.  The ability to transfer picts from the camera to my ipad and iphone wirelessly is a real bonus.  Setting up the wifi was a little confusing at first.  A 45 minute on line chat with Panasonic support was even more frustrating when it turned out all I had to do was a camera reset.

Ayush,4,If they wanted a happy customer they would have sent me a replacement camera ...,2014-09-19,N,"I've only been able to use this camera for a few days because the sample I received had two big hunks of dust inside the lens. I didn't notice that until after I had sent in the product registration card so I couldn't return it to the seller or Amazon, which requires returns to be in factory original condition. The dust made itself obvious when I tried shooting towards the sun and got big white blobs in the photos. I sent the camera back to Panasonic a couple of weeks ago and still haven't received it back. I called them and all they could tell me was they were ordering parts for it. If they wanted a happy customer they would have sent me a replacement camera immediately, but that isn't their goal apparently.    That said, in the four days I used my DMC-ZS40K I really liked it. It seemed to be a bit easier to use the manual features than the Canon camera that this is replacing. The 30X zoom is fantastic and I was able to get reasonably sharp photos at maximum zoom with good light and by using a monopod or resting the camera on a steady object. I also found the electronic viewfinder to be helpful in some cases. I would give it five stars if it hadn't been defective or if Panasonic had sent me a replacement quickly.    ----    Update Sept, 26, 2014 - I received my camera properly repaired. They returned it FedEx. I'm now happy other then the delay due to the repair. I used it quite a lot today and again, this is one of the easier to use travel cameras if you want to make use of manual settings. If you typically shoot in fully automatic mode and don't know or care about f stops, shutter speed and ISO values, this camera, though it does have a very capable Intelligent Automatic mode, may be over kill for you.

I had high hopes after reading the reviews, alas.<br />Shooting mostly in APS-C format, my expectation may have been too high.<br />The zoom range is nice, but the brightness of the lens starting at f3.3 is not great for indoors.<br />I sent the camera back and instead bought the Sony RX100M3. Twice the price and only a 3x zoom but so much better on IQ, the image sensor is 1 inch, 4 times the size of the 1/2.3&#34; of the Panasonic. And the low light performance with the f1.8-2.8 lens is very good. You can get blurred backgrounds if your subject is close enough to the camera. The bookey is very nice. I like to set the camera in &#34;Manual&#34; mode with the ISO in Automatic. So I get to chose the shutter speed and aperture and the camera picks the ISO. Not sure I would call that &#34;Manual&#34;, but it works great because the camera does quite well up to 1600 ISO.

Amazon Customer,4,Lumix FZ200 review: A good camera with a few drawbacks.,2015-06-27,Y,"My thoughts: ++Positive++ &#62;Battery life is good. I can casually shoot (vacation, out and about, etc) during the day and never had run out of battery. I can often get two days worth. &#62;The constant 2.8 aperture is wonderful for getting bright photos even at the tele end. &#62;Sound from video is appreciable. &#62;Slow motion video when you have enough light is great, in my opinion. &#62;Auto-focus is fairly spot on (does not wander too much), from what I have experienced. &#62;600mm max focal length is wonderful! I couldn't ask for more. --Negative-- &#62;Images are pretty soft/blurred at 100% crops of a photo.Not nearly as much detail as I would like. &#62;You cannot zoom, refocus, or record sound during slow motion filming (720p120 or XVGA@240fps; just fine at 1080p60 though). &#62;I thought the lens hood was very difficult to remove/install. &#62;Minimum aperture and shutter speed are not small/quick enough for very bright scenes. Images are sometimes overexposed. &#62;You must take battery out to charge it.  My background; I am an amateur to photography and film. This was my first digital camera purchased other than a GoPro. Despite the cons, I still highly recommend this camera as a first purchase or casual shooting. If you are looking for a camera that has a bright aperture even when shooting at the tele end, that has slow motion filming capabilities, a fairly long max focal length, or versatile, this will be a good camera for you (these are the reasons I selected it, and am happy!)",5,5,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,6

It has a ton of shooting options, including full manual for stills and movies.

Prema,5,"Excellent advanced bridge camera, fantastic value!",2015-05-12,Y,"Excellent camera! Numerous settings that are actually useful, and make a significant difference (unlike some other cameras I've had, with a zillion settings, that don't do much).  The &#34;Intelligent auto&#34; everything produces very nice pictures, and even these settings can be tweaked for  a better result. Aperture priority, shutter priority, and full manual really let one take control, and produce exactly what one wants. Programmed scene settings burst mode shooting and interesting, fun filters let you be creative right on the camera, without external software. The High Dynamic Range (HDR) setting is particularly useful in getting shots with wide tonal variations (shadows) to come out clear. The real star here is the lens. A crystal clear 25-600 mm equivalent lens, excellent stabilization in both still and video modes. Macro shooting is really interesting. Video is great, really much better than I had anticipated. Very good screen and electronic viewfinder.. The only drawback is not the camera itself, but the very basic printed manual which comes with the camera. Panasonic does include an excellent advanced manual on CD, but this is 220 pages/computer screens long! This really needs to be in print. I printed it out and put it in a binder, now it is usable. Amazon does sell a book written specifically for this camera, which is also very much worth getting, especially if you don't want to print the advanced manual.

Lakhan,3,"Acceptable 4:3 shots, panoramas are worthless.",2015-05-11,Y,"First, the bad:<br /><br />Panasonic has included features in this camera that are basically unusable; chief among these that I have found so is the so-called 'Panorama Mode.'  The panorama shots on this camera look like colored mud.  They are so low-resolution that no detail of any far-off objects can be discerned in the output.  The panoramas are basically unusable.  They might look okay if you printed them out in wallet size.<br /><br />To put this into some comparison, I have a 5-year old, sub-$150, AA-battery powered, Kodak brand point-and-shoot; a cheapy pocket camera, that produces panorama shots that are easily double or better in fine detail over what this Panasonic can produce.  In this one feature (panoramas) this &#34;bridge camera&#34; is beaten by 5 year old technology that cost 1/3 what this camera did.  If I would have known this camera couldn't actually produce usable panorama shots, I would not have purchased it.  For the record, this should simply not happen.  3 times the cost, 5 years of technology advancement... And somehow Panasonic has managed to go backwards.  Substantially backwards.<br /><br />This camera also produces a level of detail in standard shots that I find to be acceptable; not outstanding or even impressive.  Just... acceptable.  The shots are probably just good enough for an 11x14, that's it.  This camera is not capable of shooting for anything larger.  And don't let people look to closely at the 11x14s, either.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The camera is acceptable in low and variable light situations.  The constant focal length is a huge bonus:  This camera will be as light-sensitive at full zoom as it as at no zoom.  You don't have to think about the light, and it is bright enough to zoom?  The poor sensor on this camera is maxed out by the excellent lens that Panasonic chose to pair it with.<br /><br />The shooting modes all seem to work well and produce decent results, except for the panorama exception noted above.<br /><br />The camera is fast:  It takes the picture when you press the button, not after.<br /><br />The HDR mode actually helps to even out scenes with bright sun and heavy shadow, without making your colors look 'fake.'<br /><br />This is a decent bridge camera, as long as you don't care about panorama shots.  If you want to be able to take wide shots of your vacations, though, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Panasonic should have never included a panorama mode if this was how they were going to implement it.",1,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,4

I have used the camera now for only a few weeks.  I would rate the lens as very sharp, but not super sharp.  I think that as long as you do not make blow ups above 11x14, you will be happy with the results.  The shutter lag is next to nothing.  Even though the camera offers an exposure up to 3200, above 400 starts to get grainy.  It is very good camera with a few interesting quirks.  It is cross between an instamatic camera and a DLSR. As  a result some of the exposure controls are very convoluted, in my opinion.  The camera has a lot of wonderful features, too many to list here.

Jayashree B.,5,Great Bang for the Buck,2015-03-24,Y,"This camera has a lot of bang for the buck, and is a lot closer to a professional camera than its predecessors.  The view screen is tiltable which makes it nice for photographing down low objects without crawling around on your stomach.  It's definitely not an Nikon, but it sure weighs a lot less, if far less expensive,  and has the one single lens to cover from macro through 24x.  In many hiking or travel situations I would prefer this camera to my Nikon system, simply for the ease of use and there's less to haul around. The lower light capabilities of this camera are lacking but probably best in its class.",3,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5
Smriti,3,... camera to replace my FZ-18 which has been a good camera. There are design flaws in this camera ...,2015-03-22,Y,"I bought this camera to replace my FZ-18 which has been a good camera.  There are design flaws in this camera that knock it down a star or so.  One thing is that is is next to impossible to avoid changing the white balance due to the position of the WB button.  I miss shots because I have to notice the blue tint and change the setting. Many times my wife accidentally changes and takes several pictures that are worthless due to the wrong colors.<br /><br />The camera is supposed have 24x zoom but actually extends to 48x.  They claim it is not cropping but trust me it is, the results are not good if you go past 24x.  To avoid zooming too far you must concentrate on the zoom indicator on the screen rather than your subject.  The only way to fix this is to set the camera to &#34;motion deblur&#34;, in which case it limits the zoom to 24x.  However with this setting some shots are ruined if you subject moves  so much as a hand or arm as the camera wants to freeze the action.  It selects a high shutter speed which also results in a high ISO that otherwise would not be called for under the lighting conditions.  This results in a poor, noisy picture.  So, I have turned off deblur, and must concentrate on not zooming too far, but my wife still zooms to far on some pictures of birds, etc, and they turn out sub-par.<br /><br />The camera many times refuses to focus.for no apparently reason.  Plenty of light, and my old camera has no trouble under the same conditions.  The only way around this is to focus on something distant, then come back to the subject.  After a couple of tries it will finally focus.  This is very irritating as many times the subject is gone.  Also, you end up with some pictures that are way out of focus.<br /><br />I have lost several movies before I was able to offload them.  Can't play them back in the camera as it says the movie &#34;cannot be played&#34; or something to that effect, and I can't even delete them off the SD card without formatting it.<br/><br />Most pictures taken with the flash are washed out if the subject is within a few feet of the camera.  You can crank it down but not in auto mode.  It does have  strong flash which is good in a large room.<br /><br />Performance wise it is much faster than the FZ-18.<br /><br />As for image quality there is no difference between the two.  I have taken both cameras and taken pictures of the same subjects in the same lighting and zoomed in 100% there is virtually no difference.  I was hoping the F2.8 lens would improve low light shots but if it does I can't tell it.<br /><br />The eyepiece is much much better than the old FZ-18, in fact after taking a picture it actually looks better in the eyepiece than the jpeg that gets uploaded to my laptop.<br /><br />Except for those design flaws the pictures are good (as they were with the FZ-18) but this camera is not worth the $400 or so that I paid for it.",4,4,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

Indra,1,"Great camera when it works - repair service is slow, uncommunicative, and unreliable",2015-03-22,Y,"I have had this camera since May 2013, and it is a wonderful camera.....when it works. One month after the warranty expired, the camera would take one picture then freeze up. I would have to turn it off, then turn it on, and I could get one more picture. I contacted Panasonic Service which is a sub contractor down in Texas. I did not hear from them for two weeks, and then they mailed me a letter asking for authorization to start a repair that would be at least $189. (Why couldn't they email me, and speed things up?) I sent the authorization and heard nothing more. Weeks went by. The answer was always the same, the parts are on order. Then I began contacting Panasonic Customer Service to complain about the lack of response. This proved fruitless. There reps seem to be reading answers from a book. The only thing they could do is contact Customer Service by email, who gave them the same response that I got. Finally, on the day I was about to tell them to cancel the repair, the camera simply showed up on my doorstep - they had had it for two and one half months!<br />Now, 6 months later - the camera has failed again - the zoom feature won't stop on command. It simply goes from all the way in, to all the way out. Also the toggle from viewfinder to LCD screen is squirrley and acts up intermittently.<br />I love the camera when it works, but dealing with the Panasonic organization is hell. No way I am getting this one fixed again. I would like to get the FZ1000, but I am very afraid for their extremely poor customer service and repair service support",19,19,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2
Girija y.,5,The formal best bridge camera with honorable mention of the current best bridge camera,2015-03-20,Y,"Very briefly, strong points:  - for those who don`t want to lose time in adjustments everytime,   here you have maybe the best auto mode every built in a camera,   it does everything for you! - it`s extremely easy to take sharp photos at 600 mm with blurred   background because of the constant 2.8 aperture, even in relatively   low light situations and the zoom is very fast, as the auto focus,   it`s really a pleasure and fun to use... - video mode is a top notch in situations with sufficient light, you have really a lot of options,   including 240, 120 fps fast speed video - a rare thing to see, so you can experiment a lot with   the video mode as well - good raw quality, not so good jpeg quality (you have some noise here);  Not so good for:  - people who make a lot of photos with flash - people who want to be able to take photos and video in   a lot of low light situations: you can purchase panasonic fz1000   for this purpose where you have much bigger sensor so it`s suitable   for more situations, but you have less depth of field because of the constant   aperture to 4 up to 400 mm, so less zoom also, it`s more difficult to have sharp   results at 400 mm than with the fz200, because of the bigger sensor, but you have   really a pro video modewith 4k capabilities and amazing sharpness...    So it`s up to you to decide what will serve you best and these cameras are for those   who don`t want to bother with interchangable lenses and to carry them arround and   are ready to make a compromize with the quality (much smaller in the case of fz1000).    I recommend only to purchase them with Raynox DCR-250 and Raynox DCR-2025PRO-   great macro and tele converters - the best in their class and also great price for the value   and you`ll have everything you need to immerse yourself in the amazing world of photography...",3,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5

Deepa Mani,5,Perfect travel camera,2015-02-24,Y,"I bought this camera because I was traveling to Costa Rica and didn't want to bring my Canon 5D Mark II + heavy L lenses with me.  I needed something that offers similar quality images that my 5D can produce with realistic expectations that it will never be as good or better than my 5D.  I needed something with a good zoom for wildlife as well as a general walk around lens.  I did some research decided on a gently used DMC-FZ200 from Amazon Market place.  I just got back from Costa Rica and I am very happy that I pulled the tricker on this camera.<br /><br />The camera is very light, easy to travel.  I bought a hard case for it so I can throw it in my backpack when not using.  I've been shooting for years so I somewhat know what I'm doing.  I'm not saying that those people that returned the camera for any reasons didn't know how to use the camera, but I think that they may have given up too soon or they may have an unrealistic expectations of the camera in the same class.<br /><br />I have fairly stead hands so I didn't have any issues with blurry pictures when shooting at 24x zoom.

Shanwaz,2,Not as good as my old FZ35?!,2015-02-19,Y,"Maybe I missed something in the setup, but I found that this camera's image quality at maximum zoom was poor compared with my FZ35. I've had my FZ35 for 7 years and have reached the limit of its capabilties in my efforts to become a better bird photographer. I tried a Nikon D3200 first and didn't care for its software and other things. Then I decided that since I have had a Panasonic I'd investigat their newer models and saw this FZ200 with its much bally-hooed constant f-stop across the whole of the zoom. And the optical zoom is was much greater than my FZ35. So I bought it.<br /><br />Went out and started taking the kind of long range photos I'm used to with the FZ35 and was astonished to see the images breaking up! they looked like parts of the image had broken into pieces! [see photo attached] Now maybe I had not read the right parts of the manual, despite getting Graham Houghton's book, etc. But then I ran into a lady on a birding field trip who also had a FZ200. Curious I asked to see her images a extreme zoom and sure enough hers looked the same as mine had. So maybe we were both dunces, I dunno.<br /><br />Anyway, I sent it back. My FZ35 was better. Now I am shopping yet again for a new camera. Since the FZ200 I've also bought and tested a Canon T3i with the 75-300mm non-IS. Returned it too. Now I am trying to decide if I want to try a super-zoom again or go back to my original idea of a dSLR. Still thought I should weigh in on the Panansonic FZ200.

Amazon Customer,5,Insanely good image stabilization - allows hand held telephoto,2015-02-11,Y,"UPDATE JULY 5 2015<br /><br />The FZ200 is a great cam but after owning an FZ1000 for several months I must say the FZ1000 is better because of its large and  bright  viewfinder that makes it easier to see what you are taking and that makes it much much  easier to take pictures outdoors. With your eye to  the viewfinder and the other eye closed there are no distractions because nothing else is visible except the image and the indicators like F stop and shutter speed and ISO, which are all much clearer than on the flipout monitor.  With my eye to the viewfinder I find I can manipulate the knobs much better and in my experience have better access to the menus because I can see them better.  So... if you can afford to spend about $300 more, the FZ1000 would IMHO be a better choice, because of its superlative viewfinder.<br /><br />EARLIER TEXT FEBRUARY 2015<br /><br />[1]  One of the things I like most about the FZ200 is its awesomely strong image stabilization, that allows me to take good hand held shots without a tripod under low light and at long telephoto ranges.<br /><br />I have taken photos of Verrazano Bridge from 14 miles away, from Laurence Harbor Beach in New Jersey.  Image 1 at the end of this review shows the bridge using a telephoto setting of 960mm  and reveals remarkably little camera shake, though the photo is rather hazy because of humidity and shimmer.  I have taken the same scene with a tripod  ... and noticed very little reduction in blur.<br /><br />Also I have taken indoor pictures at night-time of friends and family under normal living room and dining room artificial light, with no bright lights and no flash, and have gotten super images with good reproduction of colors, at incredibly low shutter speeds like one eighth of a second, because of the profoundly good image stabilization.  A discovery that totally surprised me is that when people are seated in a social situation, they tend to remain still, except when speaking or eating, so that low shutter speeds very often give good photos.<br /><br />Image 2 at the end of this review shows a map of South America.  The pic was taken indoors at 600mm in fully automatic mode without a tripod.  The camera selected an incredibly low shutter speed of 1/15 of a second, and an ISO value of 400.  The picture was taken under artificial light provided by a shaded 23 watt CFL light bulb. This is given as another example of the FZ200's enormously powerful image stabilization.  The pic also shows excellent color balance and comes very close to reproducing the true colors of the subject.<br /><br />[2.1]  A second thing I like about this cam is its performance in fully automatic mode. After taking many many images, I have concluded that 9 out of 10 times, fully automatic mode gives better settings than I can achieve under semi-automatic or manual.<br /><br />It is crucial to realize that in fully automatic mode this is a WYSIWYG camera.  What you see on the LCD is almost exactly what the image will look like if you take a picture.  For someone who used a 35mm film camera, this is magical. In the old days you took pix at various settings and had to wait many hours or days before seeing the results.  With this wee beastie,  you actually get to preview the final picture, exactly the way it will look, before you take it.  And this means you can keep fooling around and  repositioning the camera until you get the best possible (or least bad) image.<br /><br />A camera that takes great photographs in automatic mode is a great camera because  it means you can concentrate on the substance of the picture, rather than being distracted by the need to set the camera controls to the right setting, which consumes time, and often means that you miss a lot of good shots, because one is too busy fiddling with the cam.<br /><br />[2.2] I keep running across reviews by people living in the past with a 35mm mindset, like:  &#34;One needs a tripod&#34;;  &#34;Automatic mode is strictly for amateurs who don't know better&#34;;  &#34;One needs flash to fill in shadows.&#34;<br /><br />I think this is totally nuts.  This is a 21st century electronic camera that amplifies light so it sees better than the human eye, designed by a collaboration of engineers from Leica and Panasonic, and most of the time, when set in automatic mode, will take something very close to the best possible image, that seldom needs a tripod, that almost never benefits from using flash.<br /><br />There are some important exceptions where semi-automatic is better than fully automatic, and it is useful to know the manual controls well enough to deal with such situations.  When faced with  rapidly moving subjects under low light, I find it necessary to use shutter priority mode in order to select higher shutter speed and higher ISO than the FZ200 will choose in full auto mode.  But I am still letting the FZ automatically control the other settings.<br /><br />But in general I get excellent pictures by starting out in automatic mode, and accepting it if the picture looks properly exposed, and only trying manual when I'm not happy with the automatic mode picture.<br /><br />What this camera does - the beautiful thing it does - is let me grab a properly exposed shot of a far away object before it goes away.  The bird is on a twig 50 feet away, with its head cocked at an appealing angle, and one wants to get the shot before it flies away, and one zooms in to frame the bird just right, and one clicks, all in a few seconds.  And voila, a really good pic.<br /><br />[3] As noted in other reviews, and super important to me, this camera calculates focus and exposure very very rapidly, so there is only a tiny time lag between pointing the camera and shooting the image, much much faster than my beloved Canon pocket camera.  Also, it will very rapidly take multiple images.<br /><br />[4]  I have not used the competition to this camera, namely the similarly priced superzooms by Nikon and Canon and Sony and Fuji.  So I cannot say this is superior to any of those.  What I can say is that I find myself taking amazingly good pictures with this camera under low light conditions, and at very long range telephoto.<br /><br />[5] If you buy this camera, I would strenuously recommend that you also buy Graham Houghton's &#34;Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 - User's Manual&#34;.  I bought the hard copy for $35, but you can download a copy for free if your conscience will allow, or you can do the right thing and pay $5 for the download.  Also check out Graham's stuff on U-Tube, and his website at www.grahamhoughton.com<br />(The user manual that comes with the camera contains useful information and is worth reading but is not very user friendly, and Graham's book explains things much better).<br /><br />[6]  Some reviewers put huge emphasis on very high resolution and very low &#34;noise&#34; in pictures, and quite rightly point out that the FZ-200 is not the best of the best in these regards.  If high res and low noise is very important to you, you might think of looking at cams priced at $800 and higher, such as the Sony RX10 and the Lumix FZ1000.  Personally, I find the FZ200's picture quality pretty damn flawless for 5x7 and 8x10 photos, though at higher sizes I would expect to see minor weaknesses.<br /><br />/-----------<br /><br />P.S. I do own a tripod, a great big Star made in Taiwan, that weighs nine pounds and whose maximum elevation is 78 inches.  In the old days it was used for image stabilization with my 35mm film cameras.  I occasionally find it very useful these days when I have a static object and am willing to spend serious amounts of time pondering the best angle and the best light and where the tripod is very useful in helping me to be more systematic and more thoughtful.

ashok,1,Waste of money,2015-01-16,N,"I bought this as an upgrade to my beloved Lumix FZ150, which suddenly stopped working.  But this is no upgrade.  Instead of 30x zoom, it's only 24.  And that 24 is full of noise.  Other than it's nice and light to carry, I cannot think of a single good thing about this camera.  Forget inside shots unless there's no people involved.  No matter what settings you have it on the image is blurry, their skin orange-y, and if it's low light at all forget it.  Even Graham Houghton says to not go above 400.  But even at 400 it was all noisy.<br />Outside, not much better.  Images looked flat.  Focus was extremely hard and took forever.

mohana,2,Nice lens and EVF but......,2015-01-06,N,"This is my first digital camera after shooting film for almost 50 years. I have shot with Canon and Fujifilm almost exclusively. I have always admired Leica products, and must say this lens doesn't disappoint. BUT, the rest of the camera DOES. It is mediocre, at best,if you want something to take snapshots with options. Fine for posting to the web I guess. But then again, so is a smartphone. I can't really complain as I picked it up for less than $200 dollars. But, the CNET review was accurate, it is at heart a point and shoot camera. The zoom is painfully slow, and focus is even slower. I have found the write speed to be the largest problem, and I am using a class 10 card with 45mb speed. It takes about 3 seconds to write 1 shot to the card. Not acceptable in my opinion. And from my experience, smartphone sensors are just as good. At least my iPhone is. Anything above ISO 400 and a cloud in the sky, the photos are too noisy to use. I have read endless reviews praising this as the best bridge camera made. I wanted it for the constant F2.8 Leica lens,which is everything it's advertised to be. Too bad the only other thing that is good about this camera is the EVF. Nothing like an optical view finder, but, very impressive nonetheless. Two stars because I love the lens.    Gave up on this piece of junk. Went back to the local shop where I bought it. Owner said all but 3 he sold were returned.

It's a steal... Well, an excellent camera for a beginner like me.  Though it's manufactured in China, it doesn't bother me a bit knowing nowadays their quality control guided by foriegn engineers have improved significantly. I read and view lots of online tips and tricks on camera ISO, aperture and shutter speed. Especially the FZ200 with it's 24x zoom I must say I am impressed after some try an error on the settings. It's definitely not a professional camera. However, with some practices I have to say I am able to achieve some rather great photographs with this camera. I managed to shoot bokeh, telephoto and night shots which are rather impressive. I would say a good sturdy tripod is essential to quality photography.  Attention on limiting the ISO ideally to 400 and best at 200 max. When shooting landscape with deep depth-of-field (high aperture of f5.6 to 8), paying attention on the point / area of focus yield very satisfying results. In night shooting, long shutter speed of 1 sec and more produces amazing pictures too. Sure am a very happy man with a new hobby. Most importantly, I know this well designed camera with a great Leica lens have more potential of churning out better photographs when I have master it.

Vinod Kadam,5,Best in it's Class,2014-12-30,N,"I Love This Camera!<br />This review is long overdue + I just wanted to shout out thanks to other long time reviewers here which helped me in my decision. This will be a combo review for the FZ200 & FZ70 as I wrote that one 1st while comparing.  I feel these are great cameras although, not so good for people who just want a point & shoot that does all of the thinking for them. There is a big learning curve. And you have to want it. I feel they should be classified as bridge cameras and not referred to as point & shoot at all. It gives people the wrong idea. I have owned the FZ200 for about 2 yrs now but, decided to buy the FZ70 for my wife as the priced had dropped at Costco to about 1/2 msr price. I have only owned the FZ70 for about a week. I think it's a great camera but, may not be the best choice for her.<br />Best tip to all who really want to learn to use; the easiest way to learn the camera is;  Go to youtube & search (Panasonic Lumix FZ200 Users Guide illustrated) by Graham Houghton. Watch some or all of the videos, study them, practice them. (Note: You'll notice in Graham's very 1st video these features will be different on the FZ70.)=Most  features are the same for both cameras with the important exception of these 5 different focus features now found in a different spot. Found on side lens on FZ200; these four are now found on back above the green play button on FZ70. After pressing this & a combination of pressing navigation/ menu set buttons give you basically the same features. The 5th I'll call force focus button is found on top labeled focus.<br /> Graham's videos have helped many a lost user like me who hates using manuals to understand how to use the camera. I had to replay some videos several times but, still way easier than the download manual! I was an SLR film camera user for years & hated the digital generation's navigation button menu system & lack of viewfinder on many point and shoot cameras.  After both of my old SLR film cameras had some break downs + 15 years of changes in the world of digital cameras I bought the FZ200. No, it is still not as quick & easy to set up for a shot as my old 35mm but, once learned it comes close. If you'll go to school as I did watching these videos,  set up some basic things in the main menu, practice, practice, practice  it's not that bad. Let me just say I can adjust most all of my settings on the fly looking thru the viewfinder like my old 35mm instead of spending all of my time scrolling thru menus on an LCD screen. With Panasonic's design of the control dial, scrolling left right and doubling as a push to select button this is possible. Along with using the top mode dial & bottom quick menu button you may access almost all of the advanced features. This is the key to keeping your eye in the viewfinder. You'll still have to use the up down navigation buttons some but, you'll figure that out quickly. By feel I've learned to do that while keeping my eyes locked in the viewfinder. This is one of the things I love most about this camera!<br />Picture quality: To be fair I'm viewing my pictures on an smaller sized 32&#34; HD TV and not to be compared to a printed image but, they look way better, more detailed, better colors than my 2 old 35mm camera's printed pictures ever did. I've read other pixel pickers comments by some of the pros; With the images blown up side by side comparing their more expensive DSLRs, saying there is very little difference.<br /><br />Ease of use; A Bridge camera is just that bridging the gap between Point & Shoot and a DSLR. They give the camera operator more control over tweaking the camera settings. That comes with a great price, a learning curve. They do have a little more of a learning curve than a DSLR but, I feel only in the focus department IMHO. The x generation raised on ipod, text messaging, video games, & computers will have no problem. For the love of the 4 way joystick navigation system!<br /><br />To compare I also tried out the Canon SX50 & Nikon CoolPix 520. I didn't like their menu system. I suppose if I had used the Canon longer I would have gotten use to it's jog wheel menu system. I used a Nikon D3200 DSLR for a couple months & with the exception of manual focus found it harder using it's menu system.  That may have just been me.  But, the advantage of having a super zoom at 1/4 of the price, lighter camera, no need for 3 lens, small, big, & bigger the FZ200 was the right choice for me. I Love my FZ200 camera! Yes, there are always trade offs not buying a DSLR.<br /><br /> There are also these things that I don't like & miss on the cheaper FZ70 that I will point out.<br />1) The len's focus features mentioned above, I miss the manual focus rocker switch option on the FZ200. It is also one of the big trade offs of these cameras compared to a DSLR. No rotating lens manual focus. You will have to (manual) focus by using either the rotating dial, directional arrow buttons or both. Manual focus tip: use the force focus button top of fz70 & fine tune using the arrow buttons. Or if wanting greatest DOF I'll aim at a target 1/3 of the way closet to me for my landscape & press the focus button<br />2) FZ200 has but, FZ70 has no shutter release cable socket! This was a mistake Panasonic not including this feature on the 70!<br />3) 200 has a hinged LCD (Huge) FZ70 has fixed LCD screen. I don't do selfies but, need a 1 direction tilt screen for when I do video pans on a tripod.<br />4) 200 has an awesome viewfinder! (Hugh for me) = much, much, lower viewfinder clarity. I feel it is critical when doing manual focus to have the best viewfinder possible. However, the fz70 is the same as the Canon SX50  which cost $100 more. Nikon's website doesn't post theirs for the 520 but seemed similar.<br />5) FZ200 has highest quality HD PSH at 60fps ____ FZ70 has 60 interlace video<br />6) FZ200 with 12megapixels sensor is better______ 16 megapixels crammed onto a 1/4&#34; sensor; I wish it were only 12 megapixels like the FZ200. I have had no problems with the FZ200 showing pixelization squares.  I have read that this is bad to continually cram more & more pixels onto an already small sensor; but, it is the ever on going marketing battle/ trend. Panasonic claims 10 to 15% noise reduction  I ?????????<br />7)FZ200 Leica lens I have been very impressed by both video & picture quality but, take all my pix at ISO 400 & below. Usually ISO 100  It is to soon to tell about lens quality of the FZ70 (DC VARIO lens) so this has to do only with the 70. I have been pleased with the quality of my images so far. But, with higher F stops would come higher ISO's so it's a given that unless it's really bright out shooting on the telephoto end I will have less chances to get the best quality pictures.  And I've only taken pictures mostly inside the house. Judging other's images & video on youtube I see a very mixed results. If you search Panasonic FZ70 videos on youtube  you will see some not so good, some average, some great pictures. Some tell of tripods, some do not.<br />8) Sorry this is the 70 a focus/not lens quality issue but, related to youtube videos. Some try to video through a screen of brush or tree branches (all at different focal lengths of course) or a jet 5 miles up which makes the camera seem as if it cannot achieve focus on anything at all. Really making the camera look bad. Come on man, I'm just saying; you can't judge the lens quality or focus ability off of that. And heat waves & atmosphere are always a problem on the far away subjects making stills less detailed. In videos U see the heat waves so you know they're not going to be detailed.

Meenakshi,5,It's the One!,2014-12-23,Y,"First, this review contains probably a few too many details of my journey to the FZ200, and second, a few qualifiers:<br /><br />I admit I'm a one-camera guy, and a recreational photographer.  I take pictures for fun, but I do really enjoy \\""serious\\"" results.  I'm not fond of phones for taking \\""meaningful\\"" pictures/movies, and I hadn't really been into the hobby since my SLR days back in the early 80's.<br /><br />While attending a benefit concert here in the Nashville area, I was very frustrated while attempting to take phone pictures under somewhat difficult circumstances.<br /><br />I noticed a guy taking shots with what he termed was a \\""bridge camera\\"" (that turned out to be an FZ200).  At least from the LCD screen's perspective, his pictures appeared to be excellent, and I was hooked.<br /><br />I did quite a bit of research, including super-zooms, entry DSLRs, and bridge cameras.  [I quickly ruled out point-and-shoots (I've owned a few over the years - Canon, Nikon, and Sony), as I never saw the pics to be much (if at all) better than those from my phone.]<br /><br />There were several other bridge and mirrorless cameras I looked at; however, none of the bridge cameras combined the feature set I wanted, along with the strong reviews of the FZ200.  [And I couldn't see any advantages of mirrorless over entry-level DSLRs.]<br /><br />I looked hard at both a Nikon D3300 and a Canon SL1, and was nearly swayed to go in that direction.  However, factors such as weight (those cameras with a near-comparable lens weigh nearly double the FZ200), \\""total\\"" cost of admission (decent Canon and Nikon lenses aren't cheap), and the over-riding factor of convenience (packing around a camera body and 2-4 lenses is a pain), led me back to the FZ200's doorstep.<br /><br />To describe the camera and its capabilities, I can't really add much to the excellent reviews both here on Amazon and elsewhere on the net.  [I will say I found Randy Wakeman's review on Amazon, DPReview's info, andGraham Houghton's You-Tube series to be super-helpful and informative...]<br /><br />Here are just a few random points:<br />1. Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve with the new (vs. SLR) technology<br />2. I've used a number of the camera's modes, and all have worked \\""as advertised\\""<br />3. The technical aspects (stabilization, zoom and focus speeds, etc...) are as-described by other positive reviews<br />4. I personally find the camera very easy to handle:<br />a. I have average-sized hands, and the camera is comfortable to hold - IMO, not \\""slippery\\"" at all<br />b. Once learned, the controls are intuitive and easy to reach<br />c. The battery's capacity is quite impressive, and access is quick and easy<br />d. Subjectively, weight is not a factor [one reviewer mentioned it seemed heavier than his D3300 - odd, since even with a \\""kit\\"" zoom (55-300MM) lens, the D3300 is nearly twice as heavy...]<br />e. Formatting the SD cars couldn't be simpler (see Graham's tutorial) - if done right, it literally takes <10 seconds to access the format function button<br />f. The video function is very easy/intuitive to use<br />5. Also as described in positive reviews, pics and movies (if done within the camera's limitation window) are of excellent quality<br />6. I have a new iMac, and downloading off the SD card couldn't be easier<br />7. And, using a mini-HDMI, playback through an HD TV is super-easy<br /><br />My 5-star rating is based upon this unit's intended use as a bridge camera.  No, it doesn't have the capabilities of a good mirrorless or DSLR; however, neither does it have those cameras' cost, weight, or lack of convenience.<br /><br />Especially if you're looking for a single camera that can readily handle most situations, the FZ200 just might be the one - it is for me.",5,4,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

Amazon Customer,3,Awkward position,2014-12-14,Y,"Despite its many pro-features and high grade Leica lens, I was unable to find a place for the z200 in my collection.<br /><br />There is DSLR for more serious work, and mobile phones take adequate casual pictures, and then action cams for activities. I find the z200's tiny CMOS sensor really photon hungry - it requires no less than the most perfect lighting condition. At night, in doors, my iPhone 6 does just as well with better post processing. With the z200 very easily get blurry or out of focus images at sub-perfect lighting.<br /><br />It is quite heavy and large - feels heavier than my D3300. Grip is slippery. But the zoom is lacking - I know it's constant aperture blah blah. The EVF can be very slow and laggy, as can be the live view LCD.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'd have more use with a compact point and shoot with at least 30+ optical zoom (Nikon s9700) than this one. If you want to have only one camera, this is a solid choice. But otherwise I see little point.",9,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,3

Macro, x24 zoom with f2.8, manual exposure control during video shooting, and so many other  features...  It can do a lot more than G5 + 14mm + 14150 combination.  Cameras do well in some areas while they are lack of certain features.  fz200 can do almost anything all other cameras can do, with the quality I am happy with.<br />It has a weight just right for steady shots under low light.  The bright Leica lens is integrated to the camera, so I will have to be very careful not to ruin the moving mechanism.  It won't fit in pockets, but it alone can replace bag full of lenses and more.

Amazon Customer,5,One of the best ultra zooms in the market,2014-12-08,Y,"This camera gives you a 600mm at f2.8 I am yet to find a SLR lens that has this feature (let alone at this price).Agreed that this will not give you the bokeh you can find in SLR, but for amateurs getting into wildlife photography, this is a great place to start. If you can search and learn online a bit, you can pretty much add very nice bokeh using Blur tool in PS. If you need more ultra zoom, you can always add an 1.7x extender that will take you to 1020mm with a f stop equivalent of 3.7<br /><br />It has great wide angle and low light capabilities too. It can shoot RAW, take a external flash through hot shoe and pretty much anything else that you can think of! I got this at a black friday deal for $300 while the current mkt price is about $450.

As word is they have no plans to issue an upgrade I decided to take advantage of Amazon's super cyber price. I purchased my camera from Adorama through Amazon, as they have a long term established reputation. I have not received my camera yet. However I am posting this because I want to put the question out to as many Amazon DMC-FZ200 owners as to when their camera was purchased and whether the camera was made in Japan or China. I was not previously aware that Panasonic had shifted production of this camera to China. And apparently both old (Japan) and new (China) stock is currently out there as of December 2014. So in essence I would like other buyers to be informed who is selling the camera produced in China and who is selling the camera produced in Japan.

Manasvi,4,Impressive bridge/superzoom camera,2014-11-21,Y,"I've used micro four thirds interchangeable lens cameras, this is worth considering as an alternative if you don't like changing lenses (or paying for them.) Yes, the new FZ1000 with a larger sensor would be higher quality but the zoom range isn't enough for me and this is much more affordable. Very good quality superzoom; the lens is very good and the images are surprisingly close to my micro four thirds G2, except maybe in low light. Fast response. Fast focus, except occasionally struggles a bit at long focal length. Very nice quality videos also. Biggest complaint: the control wheel which is used to adjust the aperture/shutter speed in manual exposure mode is too sensitive so that you can too easily end up toggling back and forth between aperture/shutter when you're trying to adjust the value of one or the other; frustrating and slows you down.

sanjay pathak,5,Very nice camera,2014-10-19,Y,"I bought this camera for an african safari.  I wanted something simple but that would take nice photos. I thought it took great photos.  I did mostly use the IA mode since I didn't want to miss shots trying to figure out the settings.  I was very happy with the photos.  My only complaint is that sometimes if inactive and to turn on from sleep, I had to turn off and on again which would take time I would maybe miss a shot.  So later to avoid this I'd just hit the button every so often to take a picture of nothing to keep it from sleeping.  Also, it is easy to accidentally turn on by hitting the switch by mistake.  I found the 24x zoom was good enough for the majority of photos.  I used digital zoom for a few but tried to stay with 24x so pictures would be clearer.  It took good videos too, several people commented on the quality of my photos and videos when I returned.<br /><br />Originally amazon sent me a returned item as new but I was happy with the return process and the replacement was new.",3,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,3

Amazon Customer,5,Picture quality is more important than Wi-Fi,2014-10-07,Y,"Initially had the Fuji Finepix S9400W which was 16 MP, had a bigger zoom, had Wi-Fi, and was under $300. But the Fuji didn't have as good a picture quality as this Panasonic. To me, picture quality is important enough that I returned the Fuji and am enjoying learning the features of this camera.<br /><br />The Panasonic can pick up details in low light (without a flash) that I could not see with my eye. The manual focus control on the side of the lens is handy to get the clear focus on long shots. The battery pack lasts longer then I expected and replacement batteries are easily available.<br /><br />There are a lot of manual adjustments you can make (ISO, white balance,...) but so far I try to take the same picture with these modes (iA, P, Scene) and keep the best. YouTube videos from Graham Houghton explain many of the features of the camera. His web site (grahamhoughton.com) also has a manual which can be downloaded.<br /><br />I have tried the big zoom on other cameras, but you really need a tripod to get a steady shot at that distance. This camera has plenty of zoom and I can take steady pictures without a tripod.<br /><br />Yes, I wish this camera had Wi-Fi and was under $400 but the picture quality alone is worth the price.

Shuvodeep Ash,4,Rattle and other notes,2014-08-30,N,"I just got this to replace my FZ35.<br /><br />Unusual Rattle:<br />When I removed the camera from the manufacturer's box, which was enclosed within the Amazon box, I found the camera to have an obvious rattle to it. It was as though something of a decent weight, like a lens or motor, was not firmly connected inside the camera. I could actually feel the weight shift with the rattle. I will keep the camera, since I have seen this condition noted in several forums. Apparently, it is a design issue that does not interfere with the camera when it is powered on. If not though, if it is a problem that may take some time to notice, such as a zoom or focus malfunction after some time passes, I wanted to note the problem now (before I could be presumed to have just dropped it myself or gotten it wet).<br /><br />Functionality:<br />It is early for me, but here are some things I note:<br />One -The springloaded trap door for the battery and card doesn't latch when you close it. It has to be closed manually with a switch lever on the trap door while it is trying to pop open. This is a little tricky to do with a camera of this weight balance with one hand.<br />Two - The FZ35 had a toggle switch that allowed you to be in either camera mode or playback mode, as opposed to a button that only operates with the camera turned on and isn't as accessable. The switch allowed you to quickly change from camera to playback or the other, right where your thumb grips the camera. A switch also allowed you to have it toggled to playback mode before the camera was turned on. That way, when the camera was turned on, your pictures would pop up, not the lens. It wouldn't extend and retract when you are trying to look at pictures or pass the camera.<br />Three - The feel of it. It feels cheaper than the FZ35 - just more plastic.<br />Four - The FZ35 had numerous scene modes, probably 35 or so. The FZ200 has something like 15. So, if you wanted it set for night sky or fireworks or candle light or moonlight, that's all one setting now, as opposed to four.<br />Five - The zoom works well and focuses well when zoomed in at objects a few feet away or more. However, the focus does not do well in close up zooms of nearby objects.<br />Six - The color of objects in dim shots seems messed up a bit. This was true for the FZ35 also. The noise and color balances are just off in automatic mode. From what I have seen, only a good SLR can avoid this issue in automatic mode.",2,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2
Salva Khan,5,Top-notch for safari shooting,2014-08-26,Y,"Just took this on an African safari, and the results are amazing.

I mostly set it on automatic, since I regrettably ran out of time to study the directions before my trip.  I know that's a bad thing to do! Fortunately, the camera does so well on automatic.  The focus is wonderful  You can see great detail on the lions' heads.  I like the way you can easily switch the focus from the viewfinder to the screen.  I mostly used the viewfinder.  My eyesight is not good, and it was easy to adjust the viewfinder to my eyes.  Flash was also easy to operate.  All in all, I'm very glad I bought this camera for my trip.

It is a great bridge camera, with plenty of zoom for most practical purposes, and the fast F2.8 lens are awesome. It is not a DSLR, so you don't get the same picture quality and range of creative shooting options. But in return you get a camera that is very easy use and maintain, and much more portability when traveling.<br /><br />The only feature of this camera that I find disappointing is the Panorama shooting mode. Yeah, it is nice that it does all the auto stitching in-camera for you, but the quality of the final picture sucks! The 8MP camera on my android phone does a vastly superior job at that. I wish Panasonic provided a ghost overlay utility to help me align consecutive shots with the same exposure, and let me manually stitch the pictures in Photoshop later. Because the panorama pictures this camera produces are close to useless.",1,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

vasundara kulkarni,5,Perfect for my photography needs,2014-07-25,N,"I write this review as someone who has only ever used point-and-shoot cameras before purchasing the FZ200. I read many reviews before purchasing and decided this camera was the best option for me because of the price and capabilities. I cannot afford a DSLR and assorted lenses, and I did not expect DSLR quality photography from this camera in every shooting situation. I've read reviews where people bash the capabilities of this camera. I was fully aware of the limitations when I purchased it and have had no surprises as to what it can and cannot do.<br /><br />What I like about the camera:<br /><br />1) Ease of use. Once I read and watched Graham Houghton's tutorials, I quickly stopped using the automatic modes. I've been able to easily control my custom settings, change aperture and ISO (things I didn't even know about before reading about this camera), and take great pictures.<br /><br />2) The quality of the pictures. Not every picture is perfect. I don't expect it to be. I'm still tinkering with settings and learning how best to use the camera in every situation. But for taking portraits, outdoor shots and wildlife pictures, this camera has been fantastic. Can you see some noise at higher ISOs? Absolutely. I just stay away from the higher ISOs unless absolutely necessary. I have been incredibly pleased with the color, clarity and overall quality of the pictures. I do some post-processing, but I do not shoot in RAW, only JPEG, and have found the pictures to be wonderful. I have no problem taking photos indoors in low light situations when I get the settings right. I rarely find myself using flash because the camera does so well without it.<br /><br />3) Size and weight. The camera is not clunky or heavy to me. I can wear it around my neck and not feel bothered by it. Some noted that the body of the camera (plastic) felt cheap. As someone who's only ever had &#34;cheap&#34; point-and-shoots, this doesn't bother me. The camera feels sturdy enough to me, provided Idon't drop it on concrete (which I am careful not to do).<br /><br />Overall, for someone who is a beginner with photography, I am absolutely pleased with this purchase. Again, it is not perfect for every situation, but it is perfect for my needs.",16,16,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

Amazon Customer,3,This Flagship Sank,2014-07-11,Y,"I have been a fan of Panasonic since owning an FZ50.  In light of my experience with that splendid camera, I had high hopes for the FZ200, which has been billed by reviewers as the “flagship” of the FZ line.  Initially, the FZ200 did not disappoint.  Shots taken in full sunlight displayed vivid, accurate color and were generally crisp across the frame.  I loved the long reach of the zoom, which allowed me to get close to subjects that were far away.  I also enjoyed playing with the art modes and in-camera panorama. The only complaint early on was noticeable purple fringing in shots of trees where dark limbs were backlit by bright sky.  But this seemed a minor complaint in the face of the overall quality of the images and the camera’s amazing versatility . . .Then I made the mistake of taking the FZ200 on a trip where the shooting requirements turned out to be too much.  I was shooting storm clouds late in the day, and here the camera’s small sensor began to show its wrinkles.  Most of the images were quite frankly disappointing, with poor contrast, very soft focus and noticeable grain.  Some evening shots of relatively near subjects were completely out of focus.  Furthermore, while shooting video through the windshield of the van the poorly implemented manual focus came into relief.  Here the camera often insisted on focusing on the dirt on the windshield instead of on the target outside.  I did some reading and tried to make sense of the manual focus.  However, it seems that by making the “manual” focus electronic and loading too many functions on a single wheel Panasonic all but rendered the FZ200’s manual focus all but useless.  Perhaps I could have tweaked the settings and improved the results somewhat.  But I had been shooting for several months at this point and thought I had a grasp of the camera’s capabilities.  (Where is the brilliant focus ring of the FZ50??)  Bottom line:  if you plan to use the camera for casual work in full daylight using only automatic focus, I believe that you will be impressed by the results.  However, if your photographic requirements stray beyond these parameters you would do well to spend a bit more and purchase a camera with a better sensor and greater manual controls.  (I ended up selling the FZ200 and purchasing a mirrorless system from Olympus.)",8,5,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5
Bhaskar,5,Awesome camera,2014-07-08,Y,"I've had this camera a year and love it.  It has the ease of a point-and-shoot with the photo quality of a DSLR.  I also use a Canon 70D, so have been able to compare the experience of using the two.  I highly recommend the FZ200 to anyone wanting to explore what can be done with photography without spending an arm and a leg.<br /><br />The lens is very versatile, capable of both wide angle and zoom.  I've used it for street shots, close-ups on insects, and for birds in flight.  I love the dedicated movie button that I can press on and off without taking my eye off the viewfinder.  My image and video quality has been great.  As for post-production, I usually end up doing some noise-reduction and/or sharpening of images, but that's true for for my 70D as well.<br /><br />The camera is lightweight, so is easy to carry.

I read a lot about it and it performs as expected. Photo quality is good, the lowest of the three cameras(pretty close to the LX7), but it has a 28-600mm f/2.8 zoom!  I don't care enough about huge telephoto photography to buy pro quality stuff for the D700, but when it's in such a small package, and relatively affordable, it has been fun to use and play with, especially useful to have the fast aperture.  It's slower wide open than the LX7 zoomed all the way out, but it still performs relatively well in low light, with the image stabization.  I do shoot RAW, pretty much all the time, FWIW.  The Lumix cameras have two special modes that I use kind of a lot, the panorama is great for sweeping shots and the HDR can be very useful, when needed.

Amazon Customer,4,Great all round camera.,2014-05-18,Y,"This camera does a lot of things very well, although not as perfectly devices dedicated for these purposes. For video, the autofocus and image stabilization is superb, on par with many consumer level video cameras. The slow motion features are fun too. The telephoto is great and the F2.8 throughout the range keeps things nice and bright and allows for action shots even in less than stellar lighting. The lens does not do great with wide angle shots, but then again it was never designed for this purpose. The menu features are are easy enough to navigate and manually input and program setting for specific shooting. The auto setting is pretty good if you have to shoot on the fly and don't have time to make manual changes though. I do especially like the programable settings and function buttons. One problem I do have is that the flash and the autofocus assist lamp are place too close to the lens and because of the lens length and width, the lens body cast a shadow on the photographs for close up night shots. The articulated display is easy to use and seems sturdy enough, but is not a touchscreen as are many competitors, not a big deal to me. The electronic viewfinder is bright and easy to use, no problems there either.

Amazon Customer,5,I have great expectatrions,2014-05-18,Y,"It says not to mention the seller but I have to because I removed the feedback when I tried to update it and I have to say that Cameta Camera (an Amazon partner) that I ordered the fz200 from gave great service.  The fz299 I received was defective.  The flash would not work at all.  I returned it by mail on Monday and received a new one on Saturday.  I am not happy that it was defective but it was not the seller's fault.  I'm not totally turned off to the camera either.  The way things are mass produced these day there are bound to be occasional defects.  I have checked out the flash on this one and it works. :-)  I have not had time to check every function in detail.  The thing I like best about the camera is it has f 2.8 through the full zoom.  I primarily do nature shots and cannot afford a telephoto lens that will do what this will.  Nor can I afford a professional grade camera, so I am glad to find a camera that can do what this one can in this price range.  I also like the size and the fact that I don't have to haul around lots of gear.  The battery life seems to be very good too.  Another thing that sold me on this camera is the YouTube tutorials by Graham Houghton.  I am a novice and need to be walked through things.  And at 70 I don't have lots of years to experiment.  From the results of the photos I've taken so far I expect to be very pleased when I learn how to use the camera.",7,7,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2
Uzma,5,Fantastic camera! Beyond my expectations!,2014-05-16,Y,"I finally graduated from a point-and-shoot, and over the past two months I've used the FZ200 to shoot pictures in the Mojave Desert, at sunny baseball games, portrait shots both indoors and outdoors, items for eBay and Craigslist, etc. I've also shot several hours of video (every pitch of about six Little League games).<br /><br />Through it all I've been very, very happy. The camera has surpassed my expectations in several ways. First of all, it's so FAST compared to point-and-shoots I've had in the past. Also, the long optical zoom is fantastic. I never thought I would need such a long zoom until I wanted to track outfielders chasing after balls way out in the outfield. And the optical image stabilization has meant that my videos don't have that amateurish bounce and jiggle they used to have.<br /><br />I like the dedicated video button, so even if you're in photo-taking mode, you can immediately start taking a video without changing modes.<br /><br />If you're tempted to buy a camera without a viewfinder: DON'T! Having a viewfinder has two big advantages. Obviously it allows you to see the  scene clearly even in bright sunlight, but also it lets you hold the camera much steadier than you would if you were holding it in front of you to look at the lcd screen.<br /><br />If you're tempted to buy a camera with just a 3X or 5X optical zoom: DON'T! There are many occasions when you will need the longer zoom, especially if you're shooting video. Sure, you could always buy a separate zoom lens for more $$, but in the heat of the action you're not going to want to swap lenses.<br /><br />There are a few ways it could be improved, however.<br /><br />- The zoom control wants to go full speed unless you're very very careful with how far you push it. I've finally gotten the hang of it, but when shooting video you would rarely want to zoom in or out quickly.<br />- When in shooting mode I wish there were a &#34;delete last&#34; button so I could immediately delete the last photo or video.<br />- No support for 24p &#34;cinema mode&#34; video.<br />- No Internet or WiFi support, but I can live without that.<br /><br />The Case Logic DCB-304 carrying bag is just the right size for this camera. The camera fits in with lens cap and lens hood (in reversed, storage position) with the grip pointed up so you can grab it and pull it out fast. The bag also has room for the Vivitar 3 lens filter kit in its thin carrying case, and a spare battery in a side pocket.",4,4,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,1

Poonam more,5,Amazing at the price!,2014-05-11,Y,"The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 is a consumer-level superzoom point-and-shoot digital camera built to a price point. There are necessarily compromises. This camera is all about the lens; and, what a lens it is! There are superzoom point-and-shoots with greater zoom range and maybe even with faster lens speed at maximum aperture, but there is nothing else out there, anywhere near this price, that has such a fast constant aperture (F2.8) from end-to-end. In my opinion, the ability to shoot at F2.8 from 25mm to 600mm (35mm equivalent) is more valuable in general usage than being able to zoom in to 1200mm, for example. Being able to purchase a camera with this superb Leica-badged lens in this price range is amazing and easily five stars!<br /><br />There are several compromises that need to be considered.<br /><br />The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200, like other cameras in its price range, has a plastic body and the build quality is strictly consumer-level. It is probably more than robust enough for its intended market and expected use. I guess what I am saying is, if you are used to handling pro-sumer and pro-level cameras, the FZ200 feels like a toy. The ergonomics and handling, for its size, are excellent.<br /><br />The sensor used in the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 is a mixed blessing. Like other cameras at this price and even above, the photo sensor is very small. It is the small size of the sensor that makes possible the lens that is the camera's greatest asset. A larger sensor would necessitate a much larger, heavier and vastly more expensive lens to perform as the 24X Leica F2.8 constant aperture lens on this camera does. The downside is that the small sensor just does not capture enough image data for making enlarged prints of those images. The pictures are excellent viewed on computer monitors, even on large monitors at high resolution. Just do not expect to print large, sharp photos on paper.<br /><br />If you have done any research on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200,you already know that the documentation provided by Panasonic with the camera leaves a LOT to be desired. Fortunately, there is an ready solution to this serious deficiency at little cost. An Englishman, Graham Houghton, has produced a series of YouTube videos specifically on the FZ200 that are excellent. He also has a photography blog with a section on the camera and, best of all, he has written a manual for the FZ200 that is an example of how a camera user's manual should be written. All of the resources developed are made freely available on the Internet and the author tactfully asks that you make a voluntary contribution for their use so that he can continue his very productive and beneficial efforts. Since the resources he has created will significantly increase your understanding of your camera and how to use it to obtain better photos and videos, a $10 or $25 contribution would help Graham Houghton and make you feel good, too!<br /><br />The digital camera market is extremely competitive and things change quickly, but the FZ200 is the class leader at this time and will still be a very capable camera for a long time.",5,5,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,4

Apurva,5,Great camera,2014-05-03,Y,"I replaced my Digital SLR (Canon Eos Rebel) with this, and I love it.  I also had an JVC hi-def video recorder (which had great video, but the still pics were bad) and my Eos Rebel had no video, plus the lens switching was a drag.  I shoot photography for live theatre, as well as using it for travel photographs and of course regular ol' photography, and the shots across the board have been excellent.  The video is good, it has a variety of options.  The zoom was a selling factor, but the overall quality has been the keeper/recommendation factor.<br /><br />The only down side I found was when I wanted to connect AC for extended video recording - there are two separate things you have to buy - the AC adapter and a DC &#34;coupler&#34; which seemed like buying a bicycle and having a sales clerk say, &#34;oh, you want wheels with that?&#34;  Other than that experience... it has been a great camera.",0,0,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

This camera does shoot in RAW format for the very best in resolution. It is a sharp lens throughout the entire focal range of 25 mm to 600 mm - all at f/2.8.

Meraj,4,The Lumix DMC-FZ200 is an all around excellent camera!,2014-04-30,Y,"I have had this camera for over two months and have hand some opportunities to try it out in some varied conditions. So far, I am very impressed and pleased with it. It's lightweight mid-size, deep grip, easy to handle features makes it a great all around camera. With this camera, I believe 80-95% of the population should never feel the need to upgrade to a full dslr. In fact, I bet many who bought into the dslr category may wish they had gone this route instead. The size, weight and need for additional lenses can take away from its overall enjoyment. In fact, you might find that camera in the closet or left in the car when you wish you had carried it along. In my opinion, keep the quick, light portability camera in your smartphone, and go for a quality bridge camera like this one for the rest of your photography. Don't get mesmerized by how many mega-pixels a camera has. That is only part of the equation. The larger file size of high mega-pixel photos can really bog down and slow down your computer also making the storage of photos another problem. The versatility of the FZ200 is amazing from the tripod mounted, full zoom pictures I got of the lunar eclipse a couple of weeks ago to close-ups of wild flowers and apple blossoms beginning to bud. I have also captured some amazing, brilliant sunsets and silhouette nightscapes. I love it!<br /><br />If you know your way around a digital camera you will have zero difficulty navigating around this camera. Everything is right where it should be. The menus are fast and logical. The viewfinder is sharp and vivid. The fold out tilt/swivel lcd is super handy for overhead, low, ground angle shots. The full range 2.8 lens is amazing. That is really important if you need to maintain high shutter speeds for action shots and like natural light and low light photography. Who likes blurry pictures? Nobody. It is also really important with close-up photography.To enjoy this camera all the more, you should have a good understanding about \\""depth of field\\"" - controlling what is in focus and out of focus in the frame. If you don't understand the settings, you could end up with some pictures that have the wrong subject in or out of focus. This wonderful feature could actually be discouraging for some people who are just looking for a simple, higher-end, point and shoot. Take the time to learn how the auto focus works and the various modes that are available to you.<br />The only thing I wish this camera had was a manual focus ring and manual zoom. I like those features from my slr background and that of a dslr, but I am willing to sacrifice them for the other outstanding benefits of this camera which obviously includes price/investment considerations. The only bridge camera that I know that has manual zoom capability is the Fujifilm HS50EXR and the Lumix DMC-FZ30. I almost went that direction just for that manual lens capability, but overall, I chose the low light capability and other review qualities of the Lumix DMC-FZ200. I also wish this camera would not retract the lens when it goes into sleep mode.  From the wrench menu, you can set the \\""lens resume\\"" feature to the \\""on\\"" position so it remembers your previous zoom setting any time the camera shuts off. It only takes about 2 seconds for the camera to resume your previous settings and you are back in action which is super cool. You can also go into \\""economy\\"" and adjust the sleep mode to \\""off\\"" or change it to a longer or shorter idle time setting.<br />As for this camera, I have not done much video with it yet, but from other reviews I have read, it rates very well there too. Again, the f/2.8 lens outperforms all the rest in natural light situations.<br />So, in short, no buyers remorse here. I would buy this camera again in a second. I hope this was helpful.

The salesperson asked me my needs.  Immediately he gave me this camera and told me to test the product.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it.

Amazon Customer,1,Highly Disappointed,2014-04-28,N,"I purchased this camera based on the great reviews it got here and elsewhere. From reading the reviews, you would think that this was the best camera ever made. Sadly, that turned out not to be the case for me. Try as I might, I could not get good quality photos from this camera. Anything taken inside looked horrible. The white balance was always off, no matter what settings I tried. Photos looked yellowish or weirdly white. Outside shots were no better. Photos looked washed out, even in good light. I had to touch up every single picture in software. Now granted, I'm no expert photographer. But, I've had less expensive cameras take better pictures than this one. Aside from the poor quality, the camera was just not user friendly. It features a manual flash. You have to actually push a button to get it to open, even when needed. I found that annoying. The worst was the confusing menu system that was supplemented by the worst User's Guide I've ever read. That guide was clearly written in Japanese and translated by someone who was not a native speaker. It gives little detail on how features work.<br /><br />After dealing with it for a year, I finally gave up and purchased a new Nikon DSLR. I'm done. I want a camera that will give me good pictures in real life without jumping through hoops. To those that love this camera, more power to you. It just didn't work for me. I cannot recommend it at all.",16,10,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2
Dr Shajna,5,Another excellent camera from Panasonic's FZ series,2014-04-28,Y,"I have been using cameras of the FZ series for some time including the FZ28, 100, and 150. I still think the FZ150 is probably the best, but the FZ200 misses that top position by only a hair. There isn't a great deal of difference between the FZ150 and FZ200, but the constant f2.8 lens of the 200 and its greatly improved electronic view finder are most notable. The lens is very good to excellent at f2.8 at all degrees of zoom, but does produce a hint of softness in the corners and just a little more chromatic aberration. Never the less, producing a lens that good at such a wide aperture with such an extreme zoom range is a remarkable feat and made even better with the internal processor of the camera. The real telling is in the image quality. It is not DSLR quality because of the small sensor, but for most uses the images are fully capable of excellent 11x14 inch enlargements and quite good even to 16x20 inches. Thus the images are able to handle a fair amount of cropping so long as huge enlargements are not expected. The combination of an FZ150 and an FZ200, is probably about as good as it gets and still have a weight factor that is highly manageable in the field. One can be fitted with macro attachments or a telephoto auxiliary lens and the other left plain. Thus one can avoid the fiddly process of adding those attachments without adding a great deal more weight or bulk. A camera bag with both cameras and attachments may only weigh about 4 pounds which is far, far less than the weight of equivalent DSLR equipment and one gets a 600mm f2.8 capability for ounces that would replace a similar DSLR lens that would be like carrying around a good sized astronomical telescope and might require you to mortgage your house to purchase. The quality of such a DSLR lens would not be all THAT much better than what the little FZ200 produces. And 9 times out of 10 you can use the FZ200 at full zoom without a tripod, something that would be next to impossible with an f2.8 600 mm lens on a DSLR. These small bridge cameras that work like a DSLR are amazing cameras that can fulfill virtually all reasonable photographic opportunities and still produce excellent quality images. I have been doing photography as a hobby and as a semi-pro for a half century and have used cameras from point and shoot film and digital to the 4X5 view camera with sheet and roll film. Medium format digital comes close to 4x5 quality at a price that will give you heart trouble, but for 99% of my uses and probably for most everybody else, the bridge camera can do it all. It does have its limitations, but they are actually slight. The FZ series are clearly the best of the bridge cameras. And as a bonus, you even get good quality video if you are into that. I'm not, but the video the camera produces is very good. Another piece of equipment you don't need to carry or buy, for most purposes.",3,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,3
Shwetha,4,"Perfect for Most Situations, But Not for Others",2014-04-27,Y,"For a typical user, I'd rate five stars. I rate four stars here because I've used a variety of cameras, and I'm pretty picky.<br />Perfect Situations:<br />This is the camera that you can grab and leave the big bag of accessories home. It really shines on nature hikes. For most users, this is the only camera that you'll need. I'm amazed at all the features and the variety of preset shooting modes (HDR, vivid, manual, programmed, auto, etc.). You can spend hours (days?) learning all this camera has to offer, but most users can be up and running in less than an hour. There are many videos on YouTube about this camera: Especially see the Graham Houghton videos. He also publishes a free manual that you can download.<br />The big plus: The f2.8 24x (24-600mm 35mm equivalent) zoom. It does not match the 50x of its contemporaries, but it does its job in low light with good zoom range.<br />Most manual exposure adjustments (backlighting, etc.) can be easily done through the viewfinder by pressing/rotating the Back Control Wheel.<br />This is a well thought-out camera.<br />There has been a recent price drop at Amazon and many of the big NY vendors are out of stock. This make me wonder if Lumix will soon be coming out with an updated model. That can be good or bad.<br /><br />Not so Perfect<br />Don't expect great results with close cropping or big blowups. The sensor is smaller than that of a typical SLR. The noise is noticeable at higher magnifications, especially for higher ISO (over 400). Don't expect the performance of a mid or high-end SLR in all situations.<br />Its macro capability is adequate, but won't match an SLR with a macro lens.<br />The auto stabilization is quite good in most situations, but use a tripod in low light at long zoom (good advice for any camera).<br />Although it's a &#34;take one camera and leave the bag at home&#34; camera, I still have a small camera that I wear in a case on my belt that I take everywhere. Yes, I know that phones can take good photos, but I find their zooming and exposure functions lacking (I told you that I'm picky).",3,3,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5
Soumyabrata Ghosh,5,"The perfect ""walkabout"" camera that offers enormous versatility",2014-04-27,Y,"My wife and I love to take walks, particularly in natural places where we might seen lovely scenes or wildlife, and I like to take pictures of what we see.<br /><br />I still own a couple of 35mm film SLRs and a selection of lenses to go with them, but I don't want to carry all that weight or to miss a shot while changing lenses.<br /><br />The Panasonic FZ200 delivers 24-600 mm (equivalent) focal range in a package that weighs less than 1.5 pounds and is roughly the size of a small DSLR with a kit lens. With digital zoom, the reach is even farther. With it, I have been able to capture wildlife with handheld shots at distances that amazed me. The constant f/2.8 aperture enabled me to capture deer in the woods at dusk and details on the moon and it delivers razor sharp images. As a fulltime freelance writer, I have also used the FZ200 to shoot photos to illustrate stories that were later published in magazines.<br /><br />I am well pleased with the views delivered by the Electronic Viewfinder and with the performance of the autofocus system.<br /><br />Sure, DSLRs and mirrorless system cameras offer greater dynamic range and low light capabilities, but those capabilities come at a cost: more weight and less convenience.<br /><br />I am extremely pleased with the FZ200 (I also own its predecessor, the FZ150). It delivers everything I need in an extremely convenient, light weight, and versatile package. If you want the very best results, I recommend shooting in RAW and processing the files through DxO Optics Pro 9. I can also recommend the FZ200 manual written by Graham Houghton. It offers a wealth of information not covered by the factory manual.",0,0,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,1
Amazon Customer,4,Great compact digital camera,2014-04-26,Y,"I purchased this camera as I was going on a vacation and did not want to lug my Canon 5D and multiple lens with me.  I wanted something inexpensive and reasonably small.  This camera strikes a very good balance and can be amazing.  I love the constant aperture 2.8 lens and the huge zoom lens (1200mm).  Together, the lens is its best feature.  However, if you look at the raw images, there is noticeable chromatic / lens distortion (i.e. purple fringing) and light fall off in the corners.  I shoot the Canon 5DMIII and am use to professional grade lens, so this may bother others less.  If you shoot JPG (which is probably 95% of photographers), this WILL NOT BE AN ISSUE.  Panasonic has done a great job tweaking the camera software to adjust for the chromatic distortion and light fall off in the corners when shooting at F/2.8.  Comparing the RAW images versus the JPG images, you can see that Panasonic automatically crops the photo to clip the corners and applies noise reduction to the images.  Most of the time, the default is just fine.  However, I use Adobe Lightroom and prefer to manually adjust color, crop, and luminesce (noise) to achieve great looking photographs.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great, inexpensive camera.  I wish the sensor had better low light performance at ISO 1600 and was slightly higher megapixel (18 vs 12).

Sabiha,5,Excellent camera,2014-04-23,Y,"My last real camera was a SLR film camera in in early 1990s; since then I had been using a series of point-and-shoot cameras, which have routinely disappointed me. I decided this time to move up to a bridge camera, and researched multiple options. I ended up choosing this one primarily due to the 600mm f2.8 Leica lens, plus the overall favorable reviews.<br /><br />I have been extremely satisfied with this camera. The image quality and flexibility have greatly impressed me. This camera has a lot of features and setting, but the manual that comes with it leaves quite a bit to be desired. After purchasing, my first activity was to watch Graham Houghton's YouTube video series for the FZ200, which provides useful advice and setting suggestions to get high-quality results from the camera. My only issue at this point was a bit of washed-out look to the sky on bright days due to the fixed aperture, but I was able to mostly mitigate this by adding a Hoya circular polarizing filter when I was taking photos in bright daylight in order to deepen the blues of the sky. I had also tried the Panasonic ND8 filter which worked for some scenes, but found the polarizing filter gave me more flexibility overall.<br /><br />I recently took the camera with me on a vacation to Oahu, and I have no complaints about the results. The zoom gave me the flexibility I needed to capture and frame the photos the way I wanted them. The auto-focus worked flawlessly, although it was noticeably slower at the highest zoom levels - not enough that I ever missed a shot, but noticeable. From flowers high in the trees, to bright and vibrant beach scenes, to sunsets and fireworks on Waikiki, I was able to repeatedly get excellent results out of this camera.<br /><br />For a seasoned professional, this camera can be a lighter-weight auxiliary camera; and for an amateur photographer who wants more than what can be found in a low-end point-and-shoot, this can be an excellent introduction to more powerful camerafeatures while still providing simpler options to get quick good results. Overall, it's an excellent bridge camera.",2,2,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,1
Kathija,5,Great zoom & speed,2014-04-18,Y,"I love this camera.  Although it's not small, it's definitely not as bulky and heavy as a SLR.  The zoom is fantastic & I also really like the option to set it on &#34;burst&#34; so it takes a number of pictures without pause.  It's been great for action shots.  For example, in the one motion of my subject kicking a soccer ball, the camera easily took 5 shots, so you can see each phase of the kick.  Pretty cool.

vijaya s.,5,Incredible!,2014-04-15,Y,"The FZ200 is a wonderful, super-zoom camera which is likely to be the envy of all to whom you show your pictures.  Unusual is its Leica f/2.8 lens at any focal length (all others have a steadily decreasing diaphragm as the focal length increases).  The battery lasts a very long time but still, you should get a spare so as never to be without power.  The other item to get would be a clear filter, called a UV filter, which keeps dirt and dust from getting onto the actual lens.  A Mr. Graham Houghton has done an extensive, free, accessible series of videos and has written a free downloadable operation manual (much better than Panasonic's) that will help immensely - available at [...]  I researched \\""Bridge\\"" cameras extensively after my 9 year old Canon super-zoom wore out and have used this Lumix FZ200 for several months with complete satisfaction.

White Lotus 111,5,The best,2014-04-15,Y,"Since I am obsessive about photography, I have tried the Olympus and Panasonics 4:3 cameras, the Nikon P510, and the Panasonic FZ200. Since I really don't want to be bothered with having to change lenses all the time, the super-zooms are attractive, and since I have been in love with my little Panasonic ZS5 for the past 3-4 years, I was hoping the Panasonic super-zoom would be an easy transition. I was not mistaken.<br /><br />After two weeks of using the FZ200 and taking about 1000 photos, I can confirm that it is a superior camera. This camera is FAST - you should see the photos of the PSU women's basketball games I have taken. And the F2.8 widest aperature applies throughout the huge zoom range - a super-zoom first. The colors are fantastically realistic - you should see the Happy Valley sunsets and sunrises I have taken. The focus is nearly instantaneous and precise - you should see some of the macros I have taken. The manual focus is easy to use and spot on - you should see some of the difficult close-ups over water and ice I have taken (it's hard for AF to focus with an ice background). The stabilization is the best I have ever seen - you should see some of the maximum zoom hand-held photos I have taken.<br /><br />It is light. It comes with a lens hood. The front of the lens if threaded so it will take filters and super macro add-ons. It allows you to store 4 custom settings. It had HDR. It feels solid and fits nicely into the hand. It has a 3&#34; articulated, high resolution LCD. It has a large, high resolution view finder. It has 3 programmable function buttons. The battery seems to last forever. It has so many ways to correct or edit photos that you will be learning how each of these things works for years to come. It is quiet. It looks professional.<br /><br />As you can see, I could go on and on...and I'm not a Panasonic or Amazon employee.<br /><br />Now a few drawbacks; after all, nothings perfect.<br /><br />I'm replacing the FZ200 I got with a new one because when I make a lot of setting changes quickly it gets overloaded, locks up, and needs to be restarted - not a huge problem but irritating sometimes. As a previous reviewer said, it is strange that Panasonic didn't put a more detailed Quick Menu on this camera like the ZS5 has. Perhaps that's because a lot of those functions are located in buttons on the camera body. It takes a little effort to remember that you set the AF,Macro, and Manual focus on the lens barrel instead of in the software - different from little point & shoots. So far I have not found a case like they used to make for the old film SLRs. I'd rather have a case instead of a &#34;bag&#34; as advertised on the webpage. And...if you're coming from a small P&S, it's an adjustment to learn where all the controls are on the camera body.<br /><br />But it's worth it. This is a superior camera and Panasonic has set a very high bar in the super-zoom arena.",1,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2

Easy to control zoom speed and length.<br /><br />I especially like the adjustable diopter TTL viewing as I do not need my reading glasses to see the external view screen. I can see everything in focus. YYYEEESSSS!!!! Not using the external viewing screen saves battery time. When I do use the external viewing screen, I do like how it can be rotated for viewing from the front of the camera, making a perfect selfie very easy.<br /><br />Dial control photo selection method shows up in the viewing screen. I like how it is lightweight, not a drag around my neck after hours of carrying it when sightseeing. Flash works well however, there are times I wish it would come up on its own, I'll get used to it.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera. Easier then when I had a heavier film type SLR with interchangeable lenses. Picture quality is fine for me, mainly taking pictures on my trips, around the city, and home. I am very satisfied with the image quality. A high-speed 64GB memory chip has more than enough capacity. Also purchased two extra batteries to ensure power on a long day of picture taking.",1,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5

Priti Kumari,2,"Poor skies (washed out), noisy - even at iso 100.",2014-03-24,Y,"I loved my Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ40 - but it doesn't allow for a remote shutter/intravalometer so I couldn't use it for time lapse photography or meteor showers. I purchased the FZ200 because it does allow for a remote shutter and many people raved about the F2.8 capability at full zoom. Today I applied to Amazon to return the camera (tomorrow was my last chance to return it). I don't understand all of the positive reviews for this camera - my FZ200 took noisy pictures even at ISO 100. The results are ok for posting to facebook, but not for printing. The skies look washed out without any real definition in them. I've tried hard with this camera - I read Graham Houghton's guides on the camera, tried various settings etc, but found myself really disappointed with most of the pictures taken.<br />The camera does have some good points  - it is fast and the f2.8 at zoom allowed me to get some good bird pictures. It takes very good video. But I bought the camera mostly for taking still photo's and wanted something light for when I travel. While it is light, the quality of the photos are nothing I'd want for capturing a special trip with. I'll use the FZ40 for travel as it takes much better pictures than the FZ200 (in daylight). Even taking photos in Raw mode and post-processing resulted in lackluster photos that I would never want to print.",10,8,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,5
SUBRAT MOHAPATRA,5,Impressive!,2014-03-22,Y,"I am not a pro photographer, so any of my comments pertain to amateurs like myself. I had several SLR cameras before the advent of digital photography, and a few small digital point-and-shooters since, those all being Panasonic Lumix.<br />  When I decided to step up a notch, I started researching the net. I had several Minolta lenses from my older SLR's so I was mainly looking at the Sony Alpha, since the mounts were the same as my lenses. My alternate thought was to forget those bulky lenses and look at the Lumix DMC-FZ200. After all, having a f2.8, 25-600mm lens built into one compact design seemed the best way to get back into the photography game.<br />  For me, that seems to have been the right decision, this camera just keeps on surprising me! I have to say that the pictures i am taking are far better and easier to get than 98% of the ones i was taking 15 years ago with film SLR's, from great macro to long zooming!<br />  One thing I would strongly recommend for anyone buying this camera is to watch the myriad YouTube tutorials right after you get the camera. This &#34;hands-on&#34; way to get familiar with the controls, the menu, and some great tips chopped a learning curve mountain into a mere gopher hill.<br />  Lastly, cheers for feedback! This is how all of us can research products and find those that work for US!!",1,1,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,4

AB,5,great zoom and fast lens,2014-03-13,Y,"Love the f2.8 lens on this (low number means that it lets in lots of light which means fewer blurry shots). Took amazing shots on African safari, would never tote heavy SLR around again. Good flash for lower light or interior shots. I don't care if other super zooms have more range, their lenses are slow (high F numbers) and this also provides a good practical wide range for city,inside or even in the car/train pics.

venkatalakshmi.p,4,I had to debate this really hard.,2014-03-06,Y,"It's a wonderful, magnificent camera that has an amazing array of features.  If I were asked about it by a friend or family member I would definitely recommend it extremely highly.<br /><br />Why did I only give it four stars then?  Because it lacks a feature that exists on my earlier versions of this (the FZ8 and FZ35) and even my husband's pocketable ZS3.  Both of us do a lot of macro photography which includes trying to focus on subjects that are often so small they may be nearly invisible to the naked eye.  Maybe 1/16th of an inch in diameter.  Because of that, we both have all the cameras set on spot focus (which works very well).<br /><br />For some unfathomable reason, Panasonic has made it impossible to KEEP the camera on spot focus.  Yes you can get there -- a couple of different ways and it only takes a couple of seconds to do it, but when you turn the camera off, it reverts back to the larger 'single area' focusing square.  That means that every time I turn the camera on again, I have to reset it to spot focus.  It's a serious step backward for Panasonic that they no longer permit their customers to be able to know, select and retain their preferred focusing mode.<br /><br />Oddly, you can set just about anything else to \\""resume\\"" things how you left them.  Examples:  zoom resume, menu resume, etc.  Just no focusing resume and that's probably the most important thing other than the lens itself.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible to me why they would omit this very useful feature that already existed in this line of cameras.  I'm sure I can and will learn to work around it, but its extremely frustrating and annoying and I believe a serious engineering design fault.<br /><br />In some ways feel that I should have given the camera five stars because I may very well be the only person in the world who uses spot focusing as my preferred default focusing method, but since I'm the one who has the camera and I'm the one affected by this omission I really can't giveit five stars because I'm not completely happy with it.",5,5,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,4
Chetan,4,Capable of Great Pictures,2014-03-03,Y,"The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 is capable of taking great photos but it depends of what you are taking pictures of and how you use the camera.<br /><br />The first day I got this camera I went to my local aquarium and took about 50 pictures and was real disappointed.  Most of the pictures were blurry and the exposures were awful.  It turns out the problem was that I was shooting in auto mode.<br /><br />After I got home, I went into the menus and setup the aperture and speed priority settings and changed the focusing mode to &#34;center weighted&#34; and changed the focusing style to AFF and I got much improved results.  I still get some blurry pictures, but now about 75% of my photos come out in focus.<br /><br />Photographing moving animals is always going to be a challenge.  I bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 because of the 2.8 constant aperture so I could shoot at a higher shutter speed so I could stop the action.<br /><br />Under the right conditions, the pictures from the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 can rival an SLR but in order to get good results, you need to set the camera up properly.  The default settings did not work well for me.<br /><br />The &#34;Advanced Manual&#34; that comes with the camera is awful.  It does not do a good job of explaining what the settings do.  Before buying this camera, you should download the manual written by Graham Houghton.<br /><br />I would give this camera 5 stars except I still cannot get good results using the Auto or Advance Auto modes.  Still, I don't think I would be able to get good pictures of animals with rival cameras from Canon, Nikon, Fuji or Sony.",6,4,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,2
Amazon Customer,4,"One of the best ""point and shoot"" cameras.",2014-03-02,Y,"There are so many great features on this camera, comparable to the DSLR I had to sell and even some additional ones such as panorama. The grip is comfortable and solid in your hand which is important since this is a light camera, an advantage to me as it makes it easy to carry around on an all day event, meaning it gets used more.<br /><br />The 2.8 Leica lens is the big attraction here as is the zoom, even if the far end gets a bit too soft, one of the disadvantages here, although I haven't found any vignetting. With the right post processing software it usually can be corrected a little.  However, being used to a 300mm zoom, if I don't push it all the way out I get good shots.  This might be difficult for beginners who want to really &#34;get out there&#34; but truly, pulling back a little still gives great telephoto shots. Having the additional telephoto/ wide angle lever on the left side is a big help as makes it easier to select them.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the &#34;burst&#34; function and the options offered.  Being a &#34;street&#34; photographer and doing some dog and horse shows, it enables me to realize some good shots from all the action, helped a great deal by the anti shake which could be stronger offering more stop difference but for a camera of this size and type it works well.  While I've only had the camera for about six weeks, I haven't noticed any lens creep which is important so the camera holds the telephoto distance even when on but not in use.<br /><br />One of the big drawbacks is in the viewfinder system.  Because I am &#34;old school&#34; and a longtime DSLR user, I prefer to use the viewfinder, although the articulated screen is a big help for high and low shots.  The view finder has a strong rainbow effect as others have complained about.  I'm really surprised here because given the Leica lens and greater cost of this camera, I expected better.  It means you can't really judge the tonal quality of the shot without then having to open the screen.  Because of this, it would have been better for the user if the change between the two was automatic instead of having to push the button to switch.  I do like, however, all the info available through the viewfinder including battery level and the red and green indicator lights as they save time.  The diopter adjustment for the viewfinder is a pleasant addition since most PS cameras don't have it.<br /><br />I haven't yet tried the video but made sure I had CLASS 10 cards, and paid the little more to get a high speed card as it greatly reduces the &#34;read time&#34; between still shots--which is better than expected given the type of camera this is.  Another nice surprise for a camera of this type is the ability to had greater wide angle and telephoto capability, with the attachments being a bit high but not outrageous.  I purchased this camera so I could travel light and not mess with lens changes, etc, but it's nice to know they are available should I need them in the future.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY: I looked and compared for quite a bit before selecting the Lumiz FZ200 (which is really a noticeable advance over the FZ150) and being a Canon user for a lot of years, it was a tough decision between the Canon G16 and this in the price range I wanted to spend.  For my purposes though, this offered more for my type of usage.  I feel this is an advanced point and shoot which places it one step below the DSLR and should be a big consideration for those wanting to travel light and not be bothered by all the lens changes and for those who are in the early stages of learning photography because it will not only help them learn about aperture, speed, and iso (and give them control over them) but will still let them put it on auto and grab shots of the kids playing.

Avesh,5,Truly excellent camera!,2014-02-28,Y,"I picked this camera because of my experience with an earlier model Lumix 18X superzoom model.

I was able to put the camera through a variety of scenarios recently including museum shooting with no flash in low light along with outdoors scenes and the picture quality is really remarkable.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this camera and highly recommend it.

The FZ200 can be used as a very high quality point and shoot camera, but to get its full potential one must master its many additional features.

bhoj kumar sahu,5,FZ200 is a great camera --jimros@pacbell.net,2014-02-22,N,"I shopped for a couple of years before settling on this camera and it was worth the wait.    This is a good camera for a person who wants excellent automatic functionality behind a great lens but who also wants extensive and competent manual operations without having to lug a suitcase full of expensive camera junk all over the place.    This camera has a small sensor.  Period.  It is an advanced point-and-shoot camera.  It is not a dslr, though it can approximate the excellence of one by a photographer willing to understand and manipulate the camera's limitations.    I do think many people would be happy with competing similar cameras from Canon or Nikon, especially if they don't want to learn yet another menu system.  That is if they can overlook the constant f2.8 aperature that holds true through the zoom range on the FZ200.  Wow!!!    My shopping considerations were:  - lightweight.  - excellent resolution  - long zoom with wide aperature  - good in low light  - manual choices for light temperature, focal length, etc.  - good battery life  - sturdy feel, solid construction    FZ200 owners who find the Panasonic documentation lacking should look at the fine downloadable PDF that Graham Houghton made available.  [...]    I consider myself a slightly knowledgable amateur.  Most of my photography was with film cameras.  I wanted better photos than I can get with my pocket point and shoot, and I don't want to spend big bucks for pounds and pounds of gear to get good pictures.    I have taken great pictures with the FZ200 of wildlife, grandkids' sports, travel, social events, close-up slow motion video of hummingbirds, and a lot more.  I have had the camera for over a year now, and while I agree that the auto focus can get lost in low light sometimes, the camera's other strengths more than compensate for me.  Using a bridge camera is a compromise the photographer makes intentionally, knowing the trade-offs.  Honestly, I am very happy.  I don't even grumble that the price has dropped to where it isn't much more expensive than buying a pocket camera...

B Anji,5,Even better than expected,2014-02-22,Y,"I got this camera for a once in a lifetime trip to the Galapagos. I wanted a camera that had a long zoom, as to make sure I did not miss out on any wildlife. I tried out the 50x/60x Nikon/Canon/Sony cameras and the picture quality and stabilzation on all of them was extremely poor. I decided to try the FZ200 and was blown away. It has great handheld stabilization at full zoom and picture quality is still great. I purchased a Canon 500d macro attachment for the FZ200 and it takes some stunning macro shots. My family and friends all think my pictures look professional (and I am definitely a rookie). Focusing speed is usually fast. Also impressed with low light/night shots.

ankit,4,Better than I expected,2014-02-19,N,"Update 2/25/2014: Disregard my initial review below, as it was a little premature in not much testing. Perhaps the camera needed a little bit of use first to 'break in' (as with a new pair of shoes). Must say, the FZ200 is quite an improvement over the FZ35, which was so worn that it is now at the bottom of my trash bin waiting to go out to the dumpster. On to the proper review (three paragraphs, which the following should be the REAL review)...<br /><br />The FZ35 was already a great camera for what it was, and the FZ200 has some very nice improvements. Keep in mind that the actual successor to that model is the FZ70, whereas the predecessor to the FZ200 is the FZ150. The zoom is 6X greater on the FZ200, better photo quality (less yellowing/color smudging at higher ISO), very good low light performance, and autofocus and taking pictures is fast like a DSLR. Well, close to it anyways. You have Full HD video (some ghosting in low light probably due to the lens mechanics), interface like LX7, and improved sound quality during movie recording. No microphone jack like if you want to use one from a boom box, per se, but a remote mic input for a proprietary mic you mount atop the hot shoe.<br /><br />RAW photo quality is about the same as the JPEG, just a smidgen worse, actually. Noise is the same. No point in using RAW, as an identical scene indoors versus the two formats, blah. However, the RAW on the FZ35 was quite bad compared to the JPEG, so at least improvement here. After all, RAW format is best for cameras with larger sensor, as in a DSLR. Also, the low light multi-frame (as in the Handheld Twilight on Sony CyberShot) is unnecessary and does not seem to work well. When you can just change the mode dial to Program and just takes the shot, which works better. That is why this camera is four (not five) stars.<br /><br />Best thing is that you have the constant aperture of 2.8, which is something you find on Sony DSC-RX10, about twice the MSRP from the Panasonic. Eventhe digital zoom on the FZ200 is quite good, just like a fuzzy interpolation. Not the aliased blocky digital zoom on early P&S cameras. Larger in size, and a bit heavier, but the excellent battery life is most welcome. Recommended? Yes. Take care now.<br /><br />*** Original review (originally two stars)***<br /><br />Received the FZ200 from eBay two weeks after purchase. Took it out of the box this evening and set it up. Really nice looking with all sorts of controls. Does not have mic jack, but is remote jack for external accessory. Do not bother with the expensive microphone. The internal microphones are camcorder quality, like those found in the professional 3CCD line (I have done some TV studio work). You also have the hot shoe mount, unlike the FZ35. Zoom is more with constant f/2.8 at 24X zoom. Viewfinder is OK but the resolution on the flip-out LCD monitor is far from the current standard (230,000 as on the FZ35). Viewfinder is larger but still the same antagonizing low-res, maybe 460,000 pixels? Colors on the display and viewfinder are very nice though. Flip-out display is tight and quite difficult to just quickly open. Something where Canon Rebel excels. I really like my T3i for that reason, but beside the point!<br /><br />Why am I giving this camera two stars? Sounds a bit harsh, but to be honest, the only improvement given the modest amount of testing indoors and outdoors, is that around ISO 400 and 800, the color artifacts (yellow and green blotches) are minimal on the FZ200, in contrast to the FZ35. However, I was not impressed with the auto-focus hunting. Taking a video in low-light is a joke, but the image stabilization does work quite well in low light as it is a faster processor. Still, image quality wise, it is still very weak in detail as the FZ35; the small sensor and 12 megapixels cannot give you a clear reading. A shampoo bottle with a 16 point font size taken from a dozen feet away at ISO 400 is barely readable. Even at base ISO 100, the 12point font on the body cream bottle is no dice for being readable. What is quite shocking is that the FZ200 has substantially better JPEG processing than LX7. I actually like LX7 than the FZ200 for the video though. That REALLY looks great. Not on the FZ200. Why?<br /><br />Very poor compression. Severe artifacts in low light, and even in good indoor lighting, it hunts so badly that you wonder how Panasonic could even manufacture such a defective system. Maybe those who are not technical experts or are use to inexpensive point-and-shoot cameras would think that if a VHS looks great, then this camera is better. Yes, better. Again, beside the point.<br /><br />Of course, you cannot get good photos taken in video mode. 3.5 megapixels as in the LX7? Yes, again, speaking of bad image quality, this gimmicky feature is not preferred by the majority of the population. Even Sony CyberShot gives the shot the look of badly incorrect settings applied to a small photo enlargement with a fractal program on a PC. Picaso, anyone?<br /><br />What I do not understand is how the FZ35 can keep the video focused better in low light than the FZ200 does. Yes, the old model hunts, but only occasional. Whether you use the full range of the zoom or not, the hunting is a problem. Even in good lighting. Now the Intelligent Auto + is a gimmick. The hype does not live up. Did some testing, nothing really mattered. You get the icon saying that it suggests helping with macro performance.<br /><br />That said, this is not worth the near $600 (I paid a lot less for that, thankfully). Consider the FZ35. I really liked that camera, and gave it four stars back in the day. It is badly worn but still works. Now the new model will probably just collect dust in my closet.<br /><br />Sorry, I really wanted to like the product. Why is it every time I go to other photography sites the image quality is so much better than the one I bought? Could it be the pre-production model (prototype?) is optimized where the final versions are dumbed down?<br /><br />I do not care. It is Sony A6000 this summer. If you want something with better image quality for the MSRP the FZ200 goes for, consider the Nikon P7700 or P7800. Nikon's imaging technology is far more mature than Panasonic. This is because Panasonic does not change their sensor technology. Not a good move. In the real world, a good lens cannot compensate for it. You have to update or re-engineer a sensor so that the photo-diode arrays are optimized. Still, a larger sensor in a large zoom camera as this would jack up the price, and I have yet to see one. IMO, you are better off with a DSLR at this size, but to get the kind of zoom at constant aperture, it would be cost prohibitive for most people.<br /><br />Yes, on to the positives. Well built like the FZ35. A bit heavier but feels durable. Very fast taking a photo but you want to set the review to zero to take photos sooner. Menu system not as good as on FZ35 but simple, quite easy to navigate being familiar with the older model. (Want to make it clear that the FZ200 is not in the same league as the FZ70; the latter is the 'lower-end' that is comparable to the FZ35, many cameras of which do not have the hot shoe.) Battery charges faster than most competitors like Sony (they are always slow but I do not mind, have some spares).<br /><br />I am done with Panasonic cameras like these. Maybe the Micro Four-Thirds system would be a better investment. Auto-focus and video quality could have been much better, and a camera in its price range should have had phase detection, but this somehow is misleading. Fuji XQ1, another camera I do not like because its focusing and exposure are mysteriously erratic. On to Sony A6000 this summer. Still, I wish it had a microphone jack like the RX10 has.",8,5,Panasonic Lumix 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black,1
Dheeraj mishra,5,The best I ever owned,2014-02-18,N,"I am an average Joe, suburban Dad photographer. I've owned several cameras over the years, DSLR, Micro 4/3rd, and countless point and shoots and super zooms. I don't have a lot of money to invest in my hobby - so the DSLR and M4/3 were not a good fit because of the money involved in buying lenses. With the exception of my Canon S110, all the P/S and other Super Zooms I owned, were not good in low light - too much noise and video artifacts. I've had my eye on the FZ200 since its debut, but the finances would not permit the purchase. Instead I blew money on lesser quality items.<br />So, finally, nearly 2 years after its release, I was able to get the FZ200 and it is everything I hoped for and it lives up to all the great reviews. The constant f2.8 makes all the difference in the world - at a fraction of the cost of inter-changable lenses. Yes, it only has a 1/2.3 sensor, but I accept that. It's still performance is great. Very usable images up to ISO1600. Video quality is on par if not better than a consumer HD Camcorder.

Abdul samad,4,"The camera is good, the manual is not so good",2014-02-10,Y,"The camera actually works well - good lens and fast response - and I like the medium light capability (all of the long lens point and shoot cameras are pretty much the same in bright sun)  I like the five + frames per second burst mode capability - tried that at a nearby skateboard park and that capability enabled me to get shots of boarders in mid jump I could not otherwise capture.  The long lens capability is nice.  I have not taken many images at an ISO greater than 400 but at an ISO of 400 the noise is minimal. My main problem is with the manual.  Not only does a printed manual not come with the camera but the manual is not well written and leaves out some significant issues/points.  The worst thing about the manual is that there is no glossary or index at the end so you have to try to guess where a topic is covered.

Mukesh kurane,4,Great camera ..... but,2015-08-26,Y,"First let me say that the FZ70 is an incredible camera and a real bargain considering all that it does. But it was not up to the purpose that I bought it for and I finally returned it.<br /><br />The main reason I bought the camera was for bird photography, especially to use that cannon of a lens to bring birds that are far away up close. And if it wasn't for the fact that I have a DSLR and am used to the quality of the images produced by a much bigger sensor, I probably would have been somewhat ok with the FZ70's output. The main reason for the purchase of the Lumix was economics pure and simple. To buy the equivalent lens range that the Lumix provides in a DSLR instead, you better bring a boatload of money and be prepared for long and large lenses that are not easy to carry or use in the field. So I thought to myself that if the image quality was reasonably close to that from a DSLR, then maybe buying the Lumix was a good all around compromise that I could live with even if it wasn't the best choice for the kind of photography I had in mind.<br /><br />But here is what I found after using it in the field:<br /><br />1. The optical zoom is indeed incredible and a pleasant surprise. The digital zoom however degrades the image very quickly and for me was not worth using.<br /><br />2. Regardless of whether I used RAW or JPGs the image quality was just simply lacking. The kind of detail that I am used to in wildlife photography using a DSLR is missing. The images have a kind of look that I can only best describe as &#34;thin&#34;. There is a serious lack of depth and detail that a larger sensor brings to the game. I am not what I consider a &#34;pixel peeper&#34; but I do like to see that the resolution in the images I produce is high quality.<br /><br />3. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the excessive noise that was produced even at low ISOs. The camera I got was loaded with noise if you shot in anything but the brightest of conditions. Again this ismainly due to the sensor size.<br /><br />Conclusion: This camera would be fine for those who simply want to take pictures of family at a soccer game and want to bring the action up close. Or those who like to take a camera with them on vacation that will take long telephoto snapshots. It is NOT however for those who demand high image quality such as you will find in a DSLR. It really is a shame to have to say that because I wanted the FZ70 to be the economical solution to large, long and expensive lenses such as is used in a DSLR system. But alas, the reality is this kind of bridge camera does not accomplish that goal at this point. I know that because I bought another bridge camera that is a competing model just to be sure that my conclusions were correct, and although it was slightly better in image quality, the same failings and limitations were still present in it as well. At least for the kind of photography that I enjoy.<br /><br />Before I bought this camera I read all kinds of reviews online and most of them seemed to indicate that the FZ70, while not completely up to DSLR standards in image quality, was not that far off. I am writing this review because I found that in real life that is not the case, and I wish that more reviews on this camera had been honest and truthful about this subject.<br /><br />Once again, I am still giving this camera 4 stars because it is a technical marvel and for most people who are not photography enthusiasts it will perform admirably well and provide the kind of pictures that they would be very pleased with. But for those who demand more in terms of image quality because the kind of photography they are passionate about demands it, this camera and others like it are not the answer. Maybe technology will get us to that point in the near future but that day has not arrived yet.",7,5,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),1

It isn't that I couldn't fiddle with the settings, or that I don't at times, but I enjoy just setting it to Intelligent Auto and letting the camera do all the work.  The problem I've found is that at times this camera just takes blurry pictures due to it not switching to a good setting.  It also tends to take a lot of dark images.  At times you think you've taken a good shot and get it back on the computer and realize that it is in fact blurry.  Our previous camera's didn't have that problem except in some very particular situations.  Then again it can take some really nice shots too and the zoom is really incredible.

karan pahwa,5,This totally rocks!!!,2015-08-07,Y,"The DMC-FZ70 is all the camera you need.  It comes with a lot of features and accessories that may surprise you.  The built in lens goes from 20mm (Wide Angle Lens) to a 1,200mm telephoto lens.  There is no need to pay for or carry extra lens when they are built in.  I have rental units and interior pictures never capture the whole room, until now.  I can use the 20mm setting to take 1 picture instead of 3.  It shows so much better when you can see all the features in a room in 1 or 2 pictures instead of 6.  The 1,200 mm lens means that I can photograph a license plate or suspicious person from more than 250 feet away or more when needed.<br /><br />The camera comes with a great case, branded carry strap, built in flash, built in microphone, and is tripod mountable.  Sorry to say you will have to buy your own tripod.  There are several settings on the camera that make filters unnecessary, but it will take any standard 55mm filter you may want to use.

Amazon Customer,5,A Bridge Camera with Super Zoom and Great Optics (5- Stars),2015-08-06,Y,"I wanted a super zoom bridge camera because I take a lot of bird photos but couldn't justify the cost of upgrading to a DSLR right now.  Before I bought the LUMIX, I had been using a Fujifilm SL300, which I loved but which didn't quite have the power I wanted at 30x zoom.  The Panasonic camera has mostly met my expectations, with clear optics for the zoom (with a tripod, of course) and options for manual settings that allow me to tweak my shots.  The Intelligent Auto setting is surprisingly good in selecting the correct settings for the scene you're shooting, although it doesn't always give me what I want, hence the need for the manual settings.  With a 60x optical zoom and macro lens settings, this camera gives me both power and versatility.<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned how big it is, and because I couldn't find it in stores, I was nervous.  I was relieved to discover that it's NOT big for a bridge camera, only in comparison to a point-and-shoot.  The LUMIX is the same size as my Fujifilm, just with a wider lens.  There's a bump out on the right for gripping with a nice area for my thumb on the back of the case -- we lefties have always had to adjust for a mostly righty world, and I have no issue holding the camera with my right hand.  I'm not going to stash this inside of a handbag, but then again, I didn't expect to.  When I'm using this, I wear it around my neck or over my shoulder.<br /><br />The LUMIX has too many features to include in a customer review; however, several of them are worth noting, especially for those who want to use this as more than a point-and-shoot:  manual settings for aperture and shutter speed; the ability to program shift; focus locking; the option to switch from LED screen to traditional viewfinder; pop-up flash; shoe for separate flash; continuous (&#34;burst&#34;) shooting mode, with or without autofocus, up to nine shots.  Point-and-shooters will be familiar with the scene options, and, of course, the camera also takes video, although I never use it for that.  I also never use the &#34;creative control&#34; feature since, if I really wanted special effects, I'd do it on my computer, not with the camera itself.  Although anyone can pick up and use this camera, it takes some practice to get used to the settings and features for a more enhanced photography experience.  Don't expect the LUMIX DMC-FZ70 to equal a DSLR, but do expect it to be much better than a point-and-shoot.  My only disappointment, and hence the half-star deduction, is the inability to use a remote shutter.  Most people won't care about this; however, for bird photography, I could really use it at times.<br /><br />The camera comes with a battery (buy a spare!), a wall charger, a lens cap, and a neck strap.  You'll have to buy a case if you want to protect it and don't already have one.  And don't forget the memory card.<br /><br />In comparison to the Fujifilm I already owned, the Panasonic is almost interchangeable except for the zoom power.  Both are excellent bridge cameras with roughly the same size and features.  The stability feature on the Panasonic might be slightly better, and it includes a few extra options; however, I consider them to be comparable cameras.  The real issue is deciding on the maximum optical zoom power and whether you need it.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannver use it for that.

Amazon Customer,4,"Great Range, Good Photos, Only 30FPS Movie Mode",2015-08-03,Y,"I agree with many others that this is one of the best cameras you can get for the money. A great starter camera or even for veteran photographers that are looking for lots of zoom without the cost and weight of DSLRs. For only $250 (at the time of this writing) you get 1200mm range, insanely wide 20mm photos, and a camera that takes above average photos even in fairly low light. It also has allot of nice manual modes to go along with a very smart auto mode. It focuses pretty fast and pictures look good until you get really far into the zoom. Then you either need a good tripod or better lighting to take a really good pic from range. Impressively I was able to follow some aircraft while keeping long range zoom most of the time. Although once you do lose focus, it's hard to find it again.  The main reason I got this camera was not for the picture quality but for the Movie Mode. I like documenting fast moving high altitude aircraft like Contrails and Chemtrails (Yes I said it) and many other interesting things in the sky. Since there seem to be hardly any decent Camcorders with any kind of serious zoom range, I had to look into Photo Cameras. The movies that this camera does take are quite impressive in terms of audio and video for a camera mainly meant for Photography. But one of the reasons I chose this camera other than taking decent photos was for smooth 60 Frames Per Second Video. The claims that this camera can do 60FPS are completely false because after you really dig, you find out the Sensor is limited to 30FPS. So even though the video may be encoded at 60FPS, you only see 30 because the sensor is limited to that frame rate. This is not a big deal to probably 90% of people that buy this camera but some want a dual solution for good photos/video.  I'm now returning to try out the Olympus SP-100 that seems to have similar features as the FZ70 with a little higher price tag. Along with high speed video modes and a better motion tracking system for birds or other fast moving long distance craft. It seems true lifelike 60FPS is very hard to find on superzooms. I will miss the 20mm wide photos that this great camera is capable of.  Again I want to point out that I rated this camera 4 Stars and find it to be on the best values out there for a camera period. It just didn't completely fit my needs of what I expected in a very competitive Superzoom field. For others who don't care about the stuff I mentioned, this is a 5-Star camera in most every way when you consider the price tag.  UPDATE: I tested out the Olympus SP-100 and the Lumix totally destroys it. The noise on the Olympus is terrible and almost unusable in low light. The picture quality is smartphone quality at best. The stablization is poor and does not look like 60FPS either like it claims. ARRGH. Guess I'll have to be satisfied with the Lumix as there is not much in the way of high framerate video for superzooms.",3,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),2

D.sharmila,5,WoW!,2015-07-25,Y,"I just got this Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 camera a few days ago and so far...WoW!  (bought refurbished from Goodios here on Amazon).<br /><br />The main reason I needed a new camera was for the optical zoom. We have a lot of &#34;flora and fauna&#34; in our yard and I like to take pictures of the various critters and plant life to share with family & friends. Obviously, I can get up close to plants and flowers, but the critters are another story.<br /><br />The maximum optical zoom I have on any of my older digital & 35mm cameras was 3X - 10X, which just wasn't enough to get good quality images from the distance I needed, like 100 feet.<br /><br />I took a chance on the refurbished model from Goodios on Amazon because it fit my budget much better.  Aside from a 90-day warranty, the only thing different from new and refurbished seems to be the box; the refurbished is shipped in a plain brown box, but everything is there that would ship with the new camera (CD, manual, lens cap, USB cable, shoulder strap, battery, and charger).<br /><br />I'm still playing with all the MANY settings (automatic and manual) but so far, this is an awesome camera for the money.<br />It doesn't have Wi-Fi connectivity, like some of the more expensive cameras, which I was aware of and really don't need. So if that's something you want, take that into consideration.<br /><br />It does have Panasonic PhotoFun software that opens up when the camera is connected via the supplied USB cable.<br /><br />You do want to get an SD card (Micro SD w/ adapter). I picked up a 64GB SanDisk on Amazon for peanuts (compared to what they used to cost not so long ago).  [[ASIN:B00M55C1I2 SanDisk Ultra 64GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDXC Memory Card Up to 48MB/s With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-064G-G4A [Newest Version]]]  and it's working great!<br /><br />If I'm out and about and absolutely &#34;need&#34; to send one or more of the photos on the SD card in the camera, I can remove the Micro SD and pop it into my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone to email or message (or any phone that accepts SD & Micro SD).<br /><br />I've attached two photos that I actually did take early this morning. One is the non-zoomed photo (trees in our yard); the other is the squirrel that I zoomed in on in the same trees in the first photo.<br /><br />Overall, I completely recommend this camera. If anything changes in my opinion, I will amend my review.xy S5 phone to email or message (or any phone that accepts SD & Micro SD).<br /><br />I've attached two photos that I actually did take early this morning.

Sowmyasanthosh,5,you can't go wrong with this camera it's awesome!,2015-07-21,N,I purchased this camera locally 6 months ago (slightly cheaper). I can't say enough good thing about this camera. I own a full body Nikon (which I love) and wanted a smaller model for certain times and situations. The 60x zoom is fantastic on this camera I can easily get awesome moon pictures that show details of craters.  Takes excellent pictures is dark lighting. Has all the same features as my larger camera once I became familiar with how it worked.  As for those saying the stabilization isn't as good I've had zero problems with that at all. You can't go wrong with this camera weather it's an extra camera for the experienced photographer to a novice who wants to just point and shoot.

I got this before my Alaska trip, and boy was I happy to have it.  I got some bear pictures that look like I am in dangerous territory even though I could barely see the bear with my naked eye.  Awesome zoom.  The quality of the pictures are also quite good.  You can digitally zoom up by quite a bit and still have resolution adequate for printing.  It has lots of bells and whistles that I've yet to start digging in.  On the down side, It feels like it would probably break if I dropped it from a foot.  I've been careful so far.  So I don't know if it would handle a drop.  Since I don't really know, I cannot knock it.

KABIR,5,A great multi use camera !!,2015-07-10,Y,"I love the FZ70, at least what I've figured out how to use. It's quite a complex camera(at least for a digitally confused man), the instructions are relatively adequate, but going on to U-tube I was able to see some of the workings in action. Probably just how I learn better, see one do one kinda thing. But the photos are beautiful and when using a tripod I got some terrific shots of the moon that showed more than I'd been able to get with previous cameras. It has a multitude of scene variations as well as numerous programs that do most anything you would want a camera to do, from total automatic to total manual operation and anything in between.<br />I was able to purchase a factory refurb unit for a great savings, and I believe from the reviews and what I've experienced from the limited use so far I believe I found a real diamond in the rough !",2,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),3

Raj,1,"VERY DISAPPOINTED,  A BLACK EYE FOR PANASONIC LUMIX",2015-06-29,Y,"Very disappointed with the overall quality of the camera, especially with the lens performance and the eye level viewfinder, of which seemed to be cheap plastic upon viewing through. The lens quality, in my opinon, did not, in anywise, compare with the Leica lenses used on Lumix's other  &#34;point & shooter&#34; cameras, as there was no seeming crispness or sharpness.  I've owned 5 other Lumix cameras, and, after buying the 270, I  was so unhappy that I returned the camera to the seller and have since switched to Nikon.  The &#34;return&#34; process through Amazon and the third party seller went very smooth and the purchase price was returned to my Amazon account instantly.  In summing up, there was no problem with Amazon or the 3rd party seller.  For me, it was the product itself.  I can't understand what the Lumix merchandising folks were thinking of by adding the 270 model camera to their otherwise fine line-up of &#34;point & shooters&#34;.  Again, very disappointed with the purchase; you do get what you pay for.  You asked for my opinion, so I've given it.

The iPhone has a feature called HDR that permits better photos of rapidly moving objects. The DMC-FZ70 also has this ability. I tested it and it also stopped tennis balls in flight. I wanted this capability for sports pictures and because I have young grandchildren that seem to be in constant motion when I want a picture. I also wanted the telephoto ability for sports and wildlife photos.

You definitely have to be careful to be VERY steady when it's zoomed all the way out because the image can tend to be grainy in certain lights and if there's any movement.  But, he's taken some really great images at full zoom and it's always surprising how close he can get.  It's lightweight and small enough to carry around all day; all the other buttons & functions are easy to find and similar to our other camera.  Not top of the line, but definitely a good value.  Recommended for an affordable camera with lots of function.",1,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),1

Deepa K.,5,Amazing quality and value especially for the price,2015-05-29,Y,"This camera has been amazing so far.  Only had it for a few days, but am impressed as is my wife who has a Canon 6D with a couple $1000 lenses.  Bought this so we could just take some decent easy everyday shots without lugging around my wife's camera.  What I've observed so far is that the flash is great!  It actually makes pics look better rather than washed out and over exposed.  The zoom is AMAZING.  I get amazing detail and pictures from a hundred yards away.  Took it to the San Diego Zoo and got best pictures ever of multiple animals like I was 5 ft from them.  It also focuses great!  The pics are sharp and crisp.  So far the camera has been pretty intuitive, but I'm going to have to break out the manual for the burst mode.  Can't find it.  Also, not sure how the aperture priority vs the shutter priority works.  Wife tried to explain, but this will take some reading on my part.  I'm below an amateur.  The only real things I have to compare to are two different Nikon point and shoots I tried previously.  The Nikons provided a blurry picture and the zoom didn't focus making it unusable.  If you're looking for near DSLR quality at a good price, size, and weight I definitely recommend this camera.

I wanted it for bird watching, grandson pic taking, and vacation photo ops.  When I was taking photos of birds, if I could get it to focus, it was great.  But more times than not, when I zoomed into the bird it was just a blur and I lost my opportunity.  Even on the same bird shot, if I got one clear, it would then blur and I couldn't get another.

akash,5,Greaty zoom and mode flexibily and decent photo and video quality.,2015-05-24,Y,"I have use the camera to take about 500 photos [at 16mp] and 20 videos [at 720P]. The quality of both photos and videos suprised me. Even at full 60X zoom [in sun], the photos were focused and the colors pretty accurate. Indoor photos with flash had to be white balanced but came out pretty good; though I liked the color balance better without flash. When I am watching these photos on my 27&#34; monitor they are pretty good; however, if I digitally zoom in 2 or 3 steps, the photos pixilate, show noise [especially when camera automatically switched to iso 400 or greater] or indicate they were not focused over the entire photo [espec. if depth of field was over 10-20 meters]. Check out sample of Panama Canal on a rainy/cloudy day, and statue in Guatamala on a sunny day with plants.<br /><br />But for a camera with a 1/2.3&#34; sensor and such a great flexibility in lenses and shooting mode- I am very happy with the quality of photos and videos I got with this camera. I recommend it to anyone who wants a fairly cheap and light, very flexible super zoom camera; and doesn't need the photo quality of a DSLR or 4/3 camera,",1,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),3

Ranveersinh? Vaghela,4,Almost all I'd hoped for a learning bridge to DSLR,2015-05-18,Y,"First, I'm a complete novice in serious photography.  This camera is meant to get my feet wet, get me familiar first hand with the 'issues'.  That said, my rating is great, 4 stars.  Some things could be more satisfying to me so not five stars.<br /><br />Zoom, clarity, basic ease of use are very good, 5-star worthy.  The combined weight of the negative factors below is only enough, to me and for now, to cost the 5th star.<br /><br />Grip point on the camera for hand shooting is small (ok, I've big hands), somewhat awkward in location versus camera mass and makes me feel I'll drop the camera.  The image stabilization is the best I've used - compared against phones and an old, cheap camera I have - but not quite what I'd hoped for.  Auto-focus is sometimes strangely flaky.

Dev,4,Versatile camera with a great zoom,2015-05-16,Y,"Great features of this camera: 1) the 60X zoom, of course; 2)  one can quickly switch between taking pictures and recording videos by pushing a button; 3) there is very little time between pushing the button and the picture being taken; 4) lots of fun picture effects and pre-set scenes - in fact, probably more than I will ever need; 5) the automated i-mode can produce good pictures in a wide range of settings, and allows for some customization of the shot if desired; 6) the macro feature can get you very close to the subject; 7) the camera can take pictures in RAW mode; 8) it can take panoramic pictures.<br />Not-so-great features: 1)The display is fixed instead of being able to swivel to different angles, which may make it hard to take pictures holding the camera above the head or of objects on the ground. 2) It takes a while to save the pictures, so if you are taking (with the zoom, of course) a series of pictures of your graduating kid you better stop before the kid gets too close to whomever is handing out the diplomas (thank goodness for school photographers). 3) Sometimes when there are strong variations in illumination in a picture the results can be quite bizarre, such as completely white faces on some people while others close to them look normal. I suspect that using the RAW format would prevent this, but I usually stay in the auto modes.<br />I am also wondering why all cameras I have used, this one included, seem to have the battery compartment next to the tripod attachment, so that if the battery runs out while the camera is mounted on a tripod one must remove the camera from the tripod to swap batteries.<br />My previous camera was a Sony Cybershot, which seemed to produce clearer, more detailed pictures. I don't know if this is due to the fact that the Cybershot had great quality optics or to the fact that I am still learning how to best use the LUMIX. I suspect that the LUMIX optics may not be the best, but they are certainly functional. So far, after a couple of months of ownership, I am quite excited about this camera - it is very versatile with a great selection of fun possibilities, such as the &#34;miniature&#34; mode. I have been able to take decent pictures of anything from the moon to bugs to family members. The zoom performs best with a tripod, like all zooms, especially when fully deployed, but the software does a good job compensating for instability when the camera is hand-held. There are better cameras on the market, but this one is a good value for the price, at least in my opinion.r a couple of months of ownership, I am quite excited about this camera - it is very versatile with a great selection of fun possibilities, such as the &#34;miniature&#34; mode.

shaikh suhail,5,I really like this camera,2015-04-19,Y,"I had to practice a lot to learn how to use this camera for it is more complicated than any I have ever used before.  Manual settings are available for almost anything I want to do, but I've had to refer to the digital manual a great many times.  This is no point and shoot camera, although it works great for that too.  I had much difficulty learning how to get macro photos without blurring, but eventfully got great photos. The macro-zoom is something I did not expect and I'm super-pleased with that.  I can adjust the lighting, color, focus and get almost any type of photo I want, though for general use I leave it at Auto-focus +.  I like to take photos of insects, flowers and birds, so the manual settings are of great importance to me.  I also wanted to do time exposures, and although I would prefer to be able to set long time exposures, the longest exposure in this camera did permit me to photograph the aurora borealis with the use of a tripod, and the touch-up function.  The 60x zoom is very useful to me and I've photographed quite a few birds already.  It is very difficult to hold the camera still at the 60x level, but using a tripod for a bird is impractical when they are moving around.  I have to take several hand-held shots to get a good one, but usually succeed.

Ease of use is essential and this camera is a gem.  The pictures come out sharp and crisp.The weight is slightly heavier than my old one but not enough to become a problem, and I like the feel of a solid camera in my hands. If you need only a &#34;pocket camera&#34; this won't be the camera for you, but if you don't mind sacrificing some size in order to have the zoom capability, seriously check this out!",2,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),4

Arun,5,Lots of fun to use!,2015-03-30,N,"I have had the Lumix ZS6 for several years, and love it.  It served me very well in Ecuador and Switzerland. I love that it fits in my purse or pocket.  Nonetheless, I was fascinated with the idea of the 60X zoom, especially for birds and other wildlife. Or shy people who might not feel comfortable with a camera staring them in the face.  So much easier to grab a photo of a bird and then look it up than trying to get one in binoculars and memorize the details before it flies away.  This is bulky, no doubt about it (compared to the compact).  I love it anyway.  It is light weight and ergonomically well designed, easy to hold.  I will keep my compact, of course, but this one has it’s place.  Here’s the range you can expect.  I took  these pictures this week.  I had to take most flower pictures more than once to get a sharp enough image, and they are cropped here (which brings them even closer).  But gorgeous enough!  I can hardly wait for a full moon!  If you drag the cursor on to the picture, it will enlarge it significantly, so you can see the detail.    The camera is easy to learn to use.  There are a few features I haven’t mastered yet, but only a few, and i’ve only had it a few days.",5,5,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),2

Prashanthi,4,Zoom lens bargain,2015-03-27,N,"Having had a Sony Cyber shot stolen from my home during a burglary, I was looking for a replacement without having to spend a fortune.<br />Camera reviews give me headaches- i I am an amateur photographer these days and the days of using manual settings of an SLR are long gone.  I want a camera that is easy to use for trips, takes nice photos that can be blown up without losing clarity, and has quick recovery - fps.  the SONY was slow.  I also like a camera with terrific zoom capability without my having to carry around a large camera bag packed with various lenses.  My initial impressions of this camera is that it performs all these functions up to my expectations.<br />Better than that - retail according to Costco was $299, but I have seen actual retail at $399.  They had it for $249 - when I went back to buy it,a week later they were sold out - only the display unit was left for $210.  When I asked about it, without my even asking for it, they dropped the price to $170.  The battery pack was never installed so what could anyone have done with it on display?  Cosmetics are perfect,and having charged the battery and taken a few photos, so far I am very pleased - especially for $170!!!",1,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),4

I think it suits well for this need, but remember it's not a DSLR, so don't expect superb quality. For what you're paying, though, I think it's fairly good. Low-light performance leaves much to be desired, I might even go as far to say the newer iPhones might rival it. That's depressing... but there's not a whole lot you can do about that at this price range I think, and your iPhone doesn't have 60x optical zoom or 16 MP resolution.

Nandhu,5,Panasonic Lumix is the only point and shoot I will ever own again...,2015-02-17,Y,"I have a very lengthy history with point and shoot cameras. I am a professional photographer so I suppose that I am spoiled by DSLR quality however Panasonic has never let me down. I bought a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 when it first came out. I was thoroughly impressed with the quality for the price that I had paid. Concert videos came out great and a lot of the photos were really good too. I still have that Lumix and my son now uses it.<br /><br />After dabbling with DSLRs for a while I decided that I wanted a more professional level point and shoot. I bought a Canon G12 and while it had some impressive features it just was not what I expected from the reviews I had seen. It was okay during concerts (one of the main reasons I have a point and shoot) but it wasn't something I was excited to use. After I sold the Canon I went to a Nikon Coolpix. I am an avid Nikon fan. That is the only DSLR I shoot with so I figured the point and shoot would be just as good. I was wrong. The quality of the photos was horrible and I couldn't get a clear shot to save my life. The Coolpix quickly went back. I stuck with the Panasonic Lumix ZS3 for a while and then went to a Nikon N1 J3. Again, not great. I did not like how it handled but I have kept it around for a year.<br /><br />I was browsing reviews for cameras that are great for my upcoming trip to Disney. I saw this Lumix FZ70 listed so I did some more research. After reading reviews here on Amazon as well as other sources such as Ken Rockwell I decided that I would jump on the low price that I paid. Yet again Panasonic did NOT disappoint. I got the camera this morning so I have not been able to fully test it and will definitely update when I do, but from what I have done so far today...IMPRESSIVE. The zoom is ridiculous and much clearer than I expected it to be at 1200mm!<br /><br />Below I posted a macro shot (holy crap!) and also posted a shot where the lens was at the shortest and then the longest length to show the power of the zoom. In the shot where you can see the entire street I put a red circle around the car that I zoomed in on. The red circle is in the center of the photo, far far down the street.

Yumnam Anandi Devi,5,Fantastic camera.,2015-01-21,Y,"Fantastic camera. The only 'issue' is common to a lot of cameras these days. It's got so many 'smart' options sometimes it tries to take the picture 'it' thinks is better and I have to hunt around to find a more manual mode to get it to take the picture I want it to.<br /><br />It is a bit hard to take star-pictures because it keeps trying to either adjust my time to get more light or take pictures and average them.<br />But that's a limitation more of the slightly higher learning curve to really use this camera. The stability at full zoom is great, much better<br />than the Nikon, for example.<br /><br />The lens is awesome, If you wide angle, be careful. It will fish-eye if you angle 'up or down' too much. Also<br />the other thing that is a limitation of most cameras that offer a '3d' feature is the 3d is not very useful because it only works<br />at 'max wide angle view', meaning distant scenery, which really never has much depth. 3d up close with the differences in depth<br />is what I wanted, but it disables the 3d if you zoom in at all or if what you're looking at is fairly close. So the twin-lens cell phone<br />that does 3d actually takes better 3d pictures for close up stuff.<br /><br />Otherwise I love it. The ring mount is 55 mm so it's fairly easy to use existing lens adapters and filters or get a ring adapter for it.<br /><br />The camera battery life is great and with an inexpensive 32 gb card it takes a lot of pictures and a lot of video. The sound recording<br />is also very good.",6,6,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),5
Dinesh Singh Bohra,1,Lots of great features don't make up for poor picture quality.,2015-01-20,N,"Bought the Panasonic Lumix FZ70 in early December to replace my nine or ten year old (4 megapixel, 10x zoom) Fujifilm FinePix S5100. I spent weeks pouring over specifications and reading comparisons and reviews. The specs on this camera are very impressive and the built in flash range is better than most into the telephoto range. In the final analysis, however, I cannot recommend the FZ70 (or any other camera for that matter) regardless of how many megapixels, great zoom range, built in flash range, or all the advanced features today's bridge cameras include when it fails to simply accomplish the primary function of a camera (i.e. taking crisp clear pictures). Even though I will probably find myself paying double or better what I paid for the FZ70, I'm returning it to Costco today and going back into research mode.<br /><br />Contrary to the \\""I Hate It\\"" comment associated with a 1 star rating I don't hate this camera - I would gladly keep it and consider it a bargain if only it took crisp clear pictures.",17,15,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),5

When using maximum zoom, on this thing, it seems to do a little better then my Cannon EOS5D Mk2 w/100-400mm zoom at it's max.

And if you lower your picture quality, meaning you do not take a 16M picture but set it to 5M or 3M, you get 135X zoom.<br />I took pictures of faces 300 feet away, clear and smooth.<br />It has a great anti-shake as well.<br />This camera can be used completely auto (for beginners) and completely Manual, completely! Shutter speed, ISO, F stop, everything manual.<br /><br />Only a few days old, mine is. I took about 100 pictures so far. IMPRESSIVE!<br /><br />The manual is simply worded, easy to understand. Nothing special explained but the on-board programming makes it idiot simple.<br />And the camera is completely fool-proof.<br /><br />So If I were you, get one. It is not even expensive.

Sowmya.,5,LOVE my Lumix FZ70!,2015-01-10,Y,"I am not a professional photographer so my knowledge of the function specifics of different camera models is limited, but as a photo hobbyist, here is my opinion on the Lumix FZ70...  Love this camera!  My old Lumix bit the dust after a LOT of use and so I upgraded to this newer model.  It's fabulous.  Has the point and shoot (intelligent auto) feature along with some manual capabilities...great for the hobbyist that isn't a professional photographer that knows all the technical aspects of shooting photos.  I like the creative options on this one as well.  I took a handheld close up of the moon (slight shake so it wasn't a clear as if I'd used a tripod) with the super zoom on this camera and was able to see craters in pretty good detail...kids thought that was pretty cool!  My photos have been consistently bright, clear and focused and the video is great too.  I would highly recommend this camera to someone who needs a reliable, quality camera to take photos of their kids, vacation, everyday things...can't speak to the professional capabilities.  :)",3,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),5

B Anji,5,Loving my upgraded Panasonic!,2014-12-29,Y,"This is the second Panasonic DMC camera I purchased. I bought the DMC-FZ18 (8mp, 18X optical zoom) in 2007 and took some wonderful pictures with it. I love the EVF on both cameras.<br /><br /> I made the mistake of putting a different brand on my wish list. Hubby surprised me on Christmas day with the other brand. I played with it but  realized it was so so good as the Panasonic brand. The other brand was returned and I ordered the FZ70 for next day delivery.<br /><br />The other brand used 4 AA batteries that just didn't last.  Yes, there are rechargeable AA batteries I could purchase, but it's awkward carrying around multiple batteries like that. Two batteries had to be placed positive side up and two negative side up, but the diagram wasn't clearly marked under the battery door. The battery door felt flimsy and it was awkward to open. Lastly, I had trouble with the lens cap staying on the lens.<br /><br />I like how Panasonic compartments have a way to keep the lithium ion rechargeable battery pack locked into position when the door opens. The charger and the battery pack are compact and not cumbersome to use.  There is only one way the battery can be inserted because of its shape.<br /><br /> There are a lot more bells and whistles with the FZ70 but I don't plan to learn it all over night. I hope this digital camera lasts at least as long as the FZ18.",1,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 60x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3-Inch LCD (Black),1

jitendra,4,I feel these are great cameras although,2014-12-29,N,"This is a review for the FZ70<br />I feel these are great cameras although, not so good for people who just want a point & shoot to do all of the thinking for them.<br /><br />Best tip: the easiest way to learn the camera is;  Go to youtube & search (Panasonic Lumix FZ200 Users Guide illustrated) by Graham Houghton. Watch some or all of the videos, study them, practice them. I have both cameras & most features are the same!(Note: You'll notice in Graham's very 1st video these features will be different on the FZ70.)=Most  features are the same, with the exception of these 5 different focus features;  Found on side lens on FZ200; these 4 are now found on back above the green play button on FZ70. After pressing this & a combination of pressing navigation & menu set buttons give you basically the same features. The 5th I'll call force focus button is found on top labeled focus.<br /> Graham's videos have helped many a lost user like me who hates using manuals to understand how to use the camera. I had to replay some videos several times but, still way easier than the download manual!  __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />  Comparing the 2 cameras these are the features I miss most<br /><br />1) The len's focus features mentioned above, I miss the manual focus rocker switch option on the FZ200. It is also one of the biggest trade offs of these cameras compared to a DSLR. No rotating lens manual focus. You have to (manual) focus by turning a dial, or using directional arrow buttons. note: fz70 has several auto focus options.<br /><br />2) (Huge) the FZ70 has no shutter release cable socket! This was a mistake Panasonic not including this feature!<br /><br />3) (Huge) the fixed LCD screen. I don't do selfies but, need for video pans on a tripod.<br /><br />4) (Hugh for me) = much, much, lower viewfinder clarity. I feel it is critical when doing manual focus to have the best viewfinder possible. However, the fz70 is the same as the Canon SX50  which cost $100 more. Nikon doesn't even post theirs for the 520 but seemed similar.<br /><br />5) 60p (i) video<br /><br />6) 16 megapixels crammed onto a 1/4\\"" censor; I wish it were only 12 megapixels like the FZ200. I have had no problems with the FZ200 showing pixelization squares.  I have read that this is bad to continually cram more & more pixels onto an already small sensor; but, it is the ever on going marketing battle/ trend. Panasonic claims 10 to 15% noise reduction but, I'm not convinced.<br /><br />6) To soon to tell about lens quality (the DC VARIO lens)<br />OOPS! This should have been #1 the constant aperture F2.8 but, the 70 is much less expensive so this is to be expected.<br /><br />7) No slow speed video option.  ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Things that FZ70 got right!<br /><br />1) the raised buttons, 100% easier to use. The video button is so hard to start & stop on the FZ200.<br /><br />2) The right side hand grip design; (Huge improvement!) If you own the fz200 you know what I mean.=bad design! I am always accidently turning on the white balance menu with the heel of my hand. So much so that I glued a plumbing washer around the 4 way navigation/ menu set button. This however makes it much harder to use the navigation buttons. So it was a trade off but, that is how crazy it made me; Accidently turning on the white balance menu all the time .<br /><br />3) The Zoom; what can I say! 20mm on the wide end to 1,200mm on the tel end. Even with the other flaws for just over $200  to be able to own that much range. I am not a professional so even if some blast it, calling it a toy. It would cost $800 to $1,300 for a cheaper slower 150mm to 600mm lens. Then about $800 for a cheaper DSLR and 2 lens kit to cover wide angle up to  150mm. And FZ70 takes great pictures. Plenty good for 1080p TV size pix. Iwill probably make more use from the wide end but, I do live in an area rich in big game wildlife & bald eagles. I can't wait for summer!<br /><br />So if Panasonic would combine all of these great feature on the same camera they'd have a super great camera. And one more suggestion Panasonic a vertical decision wheel to complement the horizontal decision wheel. This would be used instead of the arrow buttons for up & down. Are you listening Panasonic?<br />Using my newest designed Lumix with vertical & horizontal wheels + quick menu my eye would never leave the viewfinder except to walk.<br /><br />Hope this helps!bly make more use from the wide end but, I do live in an area rich in big game wildlife & bald eagles.

Using my newest designed Lumix with vertical & horizontal wheels + quick menu my eye would never leave the viewfinder except to walk.    Hope this helps!ery mixed results. If you search Panasonic FZ70 videos on youtube  you will see some not so good, some average, some good. Some tell of tripods, some do not. Some try to video through a screen of brush or tree branches (all at different focal lenghts of course) or a jet 5 miles up which makes the camera seem as if it cannot achive focus on anything at all. Come on man, I'm just saying; you can't judge the lens quality or focus ability off of that. And heat waves are always a problem on the far end making stills less detailed. In videos U see the heat waves so you know they're not going to be detailed. Hey, I own a spoting scope. At close up to 100 yds. shots are quite good. I do a lot of landscape photos so I did feel that most images I've seen on the wide angle end were a bit soft; lacking detail. Come summer I will try & update this review.<br />Now what I like better on the FZ70 over the FZ200. Panasonic must have listened to the two biggest FZ200 complaints.<br />1) the raised buttons, 100% easier to use. The video button is so hard to start & stop on the FZ200.  Also the buttons are smartly placed all on the right hand side. So if U memorize their location by touch & hold camera barrel with left hand all are easily in reach with the right thumb.  Not that they were bad on the fz200.<br /> 2) The right side hand grip design; (Huge improvement!) If you own the fz200 you know what I mean. I am always accidently turning on the white balance menus with the heel of my hand. So much so that I glued a plumbing washer around the 4 way navigation/ menus set button. This however makes it much harder to use the navigation buttons. So it was a trade off but, that is how crazy it made me; Accidently turning on the white balance menus all the time .<br />3) The Zoom; what can I say! 20mm on the wide end to 1,200mm on the tel end.

I will probably make more use from the wide end but, I do live in an area rich in big game wildlife & bald eagles. I can't wait for summer!<br />If Panasonic would combine all of these great feature on the same camera they'd have a super great camera. And one more suggestion Panasonic a vertical decision wheel next to the upper decision wheel. This would be used instead of the arrow buttons. Are you listening Panasonic? That & moving the quick menus to the top my eye would never need to leave the viewfinder except to walk.<br />Hope this helps!<br />  ps.

Tabu Leriak,1,Very Unimpressed... Stay Away...,2014-12-25,N,"I must be a technical moron when I see how many 4 star ratings this camera has received but alas, I have given this thing a very fair trial of over 6 months now and it sucks.  Plain and simple.  We got this camera anticipating the birth of our child back in June.  I've taken no less than 250 photos which culminated this Christmas morning as being so disappointing, I am taking time to write an Amazon review! (take this fact into consideration).  No &#34;tech jargon&#34; required, the camera doesn't do the most BASIC of components that ANY decent camera should do.  Pictures are ALL FUZZY (already 90% of them are fuzzy), It does not FOCUS worth a lick (photos never seem sharp), photo BLUR on nearly every shot.  And these occur on the alleged &#34;intelligent auto&#34; setting which is to supposedly compensate for the fact I don't work for a photography studio. If &#34;auto&#34; features don't render at least an appreciable photo, what good is this camera.  It's going in the trash - seriously.  Thank you iPhone 5 for producing 1st morning Christmas photos that best a dedicated SLR camera by Panasonic!

I have even dropped mine off a Harley at 40 MPH  .. first time .. and again at about 10 MPH. *The result of setting the camera on my camping gear tied to the back fender and taking off down the road. When I hit the brakes the camera passed me by on the way to the ground. Both times it hit pavement. At 40MPH it tumbled. At 10MPH it landed flat and broke the latch. The camera is dinged up a bit and the access door latch on the bottom is broken (see repair pics)  .. but the camera continues to work every day since, and that has been 3 years past. I just bought this one to replace it whenever it does die. I hope they continue to manufacture this model .. but I know someday soon they may stop production .. so I've got my spare .. and at a great price.<br />PS  I bought the LX100 as I thought it was the replacement for this model .. it's not . the LX100 is a completely different animal .. it takes better pictures .. but it lacks a built in flash and the zoom is pitiful .. great camera .. just different.

I was on hold for 37 minutes and finally called it quits. I eventually had to send the camera to Panasonic's service center in McAllen Texas.

I've changed the rating from 3 to 4 stars as the more I use the LX7, the more I like it.  I went and bought the viewfinder which was expensive, but made it easy to take outdoor pictures.

abhiram,5,Excellent camera for home and travel,2015-03-18,Y,"I'm a retired pro photographer from the Nikon F2, Leica M4 and Hasselblad era. After dozens of cameras I now have Panasonic's GH4 and LX7. I use the LX7 mostly for home and travel videos. In my bag the predecessor of the LX7 was Canon's  S95.<br /><br />Recently my son decided to sell his Sony RX100M3 camera. I have used it a month side by side with the Panasonic LX7. After that the decision was quite easy. I'm going to keep the LX7.<br /><br />The Sony RX100 produces sharper still pictures. But if you don't crop much or make large prints, you don't see the difference. In movie making the RX100M3 has several problems. You can't lock the focus (or after auto focusing you have to switch to manual focusing, shoot and again switch back to auto focusing, which is too complicated). For that you need one programmable button. Same thing with the exposure locking.  A second programmable button is needed for that. The Panasonic LX7 has a dedicated AF/AE locking button.<br /><br />The auto exposure of the LX7 is better. Most video clips are just perfect. You can really trust the LX7, which is very valuable in practical home and travel movie making. You don't have to always check the takes. On the other hand, with the RX100M3 you'd better to make these exposure checks as often as possible.<br /><br />The LX7 has a better AWB indoors. The LX7 sits better in hand. In addition to the red video button, with the LX7 you can use the main shutter button to start and stop the take.<br /><br />The colors of the Sony and Panasonic are nearly identical. I really like them. They resemble the Ektachrome colors of the old times. The Canon S95 is more like a Kodachrome camera.<br /><br />I use the LX7 with a wrist strap (sold separately). After several tries I now have Zeikos ZE-CA15B soft case (3.99 at Amazon), where the LX7 fits perfectly.",15,14,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,2
Soumen Roy,1,"Very disapointed, poor image quality, camera does not work, no support on their products.",2015-03-17,Y,I am very disappointed with this camera. For a higher end point and shoot I expected more. When you shoot JPEGs the DPI resolution is only 180 pixels per square inch. My very old cheap Sony point and shoot shot at 300 DPI. I bought this camera mainly because it shoots in camera RAW format. I set it up to do bracketed exposures in program mode that is -2 0-+2 but it only shoots -2 and two 0 exposures.<br /><br />I called their support about the bracketing problem and after giving them all my personal information was told they would reset the camera for $7.50. So you can forget about getting any support from this company on their products.<br /><br />They should stick to TV's and get out of the Camera business.,14,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,4

Amazon Customer,5,fast lens,2014-12-31,Y,"I bought this camera after having owned an RX100 because in the end I felt the most important thing to me was to be able to throw the background out of focus, and this camera had the ability to open up the aperture, even while zooming, more than any other point and shoot that I could find at that time (March 2014). I still found myself relying on my iPhone as I don't like carrying stuff, but on camping trips I found doing a lot of photos and video with my iPhone really could use up my phone battery life, so I started carrying this camera. I do enjoy using it.. it has a good feel. I would love to use the more expensive cameras from this line.. I have a friend who has one that is somewhere around 20mp and also has the wide aperture even while zooming. But it is way bigger and heavier than this camera, and the reality is, in the end, I won't carry anything that big. This camera seemed like the perfect compromise. And BTW, I don't think the kit lens on my Canon Rebel open up as far as this one. You have to buy expensive lenses for your SLR to get the fast lens. Basically, images can get busy if the whole background is in focus.

I picked up this P&S just over a year ago to fill a couple of gaps. First being we needed a P&S for my wife that worked well on auto. Second we needed a decent quick and go video recorded. Both gaps were filled brilliantly. More so with the video. This camera takes exceptional pictures but what it even does better is takes HD video. It's just gorgeous to watch. Also the iAuto works wonders. The jpegs are super which is nice because this is how my wife is going to shoot.<br /><br />The other pluses of the P&S is the manual abilities. It's nice for myself because when I don't want to be loaded down with the heft of a DSLR I have an alternative that is going to give me options. The raws are nothing short of fantastic.

It has performed awesome.<br /><br />Pictures: Stunning. The colors are well balanced and sharp. The edges are precise. When I shot at the max shutter speed after hiking down to the beach, I was able to get waves at maximum crest with drops of water spraying off.<br /><br />Manual controls: Being able to change the aperture and shutter speed easily was very useful almost every time I've used this camera. I like to shoot on aperture control, and having that as a manual dial on the lens edge made life very easy.<br /><br />Lens: The lens is crisp and clear. It comes with a lens cap and a strap to keep it watched tot he camera when shooting.<br /><br />Size: It's a bit bigger than a standard point and shoot, and a lot bigger than a cell phone. But it is worth it. The ability to speed the shots up, or do long exposures, or open the aperture up make the slightly larger size tolerable.<br /><br />Case: I didn't think to buy a case until I was already traveling. This was a mistake. I've used a case that barely fits the camera, but does keep it safe. I should've just ponied up right away for a case that fits the actual camera appropriately. Because the lens sticks out as far as it does, it makes sense to get a properly paired case.<br /><br />Battery life: I used it on a single charge for several weeks in a very austere country. I have also used it on a family vacation for over a week without a recharge.

Manik Kirtania,5,A tool for artists with lasting value -- even in 2014,2014-10-29,Y,"I came to the LX7 after years of joyful experience with the now venerable[[ASIN:B001CCLBSA Panasonic DMC-LX3 10.1MP Digital Camera with 24mm Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)]].  (I skipped the intermediate [[ASIN:B003WJR69E Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD - Black]], which has many of the features missing from the LX3 and found in the LX7.)  What these cameras have in common is superior engineering and ergonomics, a beautiful design informed by classic cameras of the past, Leica optics (part of that heritage), and settings from the fully automatic to completely manual.  Just holding these cameras communicates their essence as finely crafted instruments -- solid, carefully machined metal in lieu of plastic, and an excellent feel in-hand.<br /><br />Of course, time marches on and the Lumix LX100 [[ASIN:B00GORMJTI Panasonic LUMIX LX100 16.8 MP Point and Shoot Camera with Integrated Leica DC Lens (Black)]], the successor in the line, is coming on November 1, 2014.  And, yes, it has some amazing specifications that push the envelope of available technology, including 4K video and bigger sensor.  It's also about twice as expensive and bigger.  But, in the end, it's about the photographs.  And when you leap to the price point for LX100, there are plenty of options with interchangeable lenses.  All of that needs to be factored into the equation.<br /><br />But, in the end, it's about the photographs.  And that's where the LX7 shines.  The entire package brings out the artist in me, and it seems to do the same for the many other passionate fans of this camera.  It substantially betters the LX3 in the one area that needed improvement -- a more powerful zoom.<br /><br />This is a great camera.

Extremely and both.<br /><br />Three shortcomings: short tele, which I knew going in; complicated flash mode (never mastered a good fill-flash technique); and, after it got wet in the rain, the command dial would only decrease the shutter speed. I got used to the command dial quirk, working around it with the menu button.<br /><br />I used it heavily for 16 months at a daily paper (where it got rained on), and the fill-flash issue was seldom a problem with the 1.4 aperture, but still....

Afzal Masroor,5,Superb image quality in a compact and versatile camera,2014-10-08,Y,"Bought the LX7 to replace an older Lumix. Exceeds my expectations. Superb image quality. Love the ability to control depth-of-field such as in mountain flower photography. The iA mode works well. I found it difficult to discern image quality or treatment of light differences when shot in iA versus the other modes. The ability to manually control the aspect ratio, aperture and focussing programs via the outboard ring is a fab feature.<br />This camera is ideal for travel. But do get a backup battery. I have not verified whether the battery can deliver the claimed 330 JPGs per charge. That claim is likely inflated.<br />I don't like the way the outer lens is so exposed and easily directly contacted [dirty fingers for one as well as possible contact with damaging surfaces]. I got an adapter ring from Goja, a high quality UV filter [37 mm UV-Haze F-Pro B + W filter], and a JJC Auo Open/Close lens cap. Much better protection for the lens.

It is light and compact, and yet gave me tremendous shooting flexibility.  I got beautiful, crisp pictures inside churches and cathedrals.  I captured some lovely night shots from a vaporetto on the Grand Canal in Venice.  (Okay, the night shots were a little noisy, but at 11 p.m. on a foggy night in a moving boat with almost no light, I was  amazed that I got anything at all.)  The macro ability came in handy for closeups.<br /><br />This is a versatile camera that gives me incredible control (manual controls, aperture ring, etc.)  in a small and affordable package.

It is easy to use and makes adjustments automatically depending on light etc.  It's light weight made it very pleasant for sight seeing making it easy to slip into my purse.

Yashdeep,5,Case for the LX7 with the optional DMW-LVF2 viewfinder,2014-06-28,N,"There are enough reviews of the camera itself. Here is an answer for those who cannot find a carrying case for the LX7 with optional  DMW-LVF2 viewfinder.<br /><br />As with previous Panasonic p&s cameras I have owned I prefer a carry case that can be worn securely on the belt which requires taking the belt off, threading it through, and putting the belt back on. I carry the LX7 with the optional DMW-LVF2 viewfinder and JJC auto lens cap attached all the time.<br /><br />My preferred case is the Manfrotto Nano VII Camera Pouch. The dimensions of this carry case are perfect for the LX7 carried in my configuration. It consists of water-repellent nylon, Velcro fastener, belt loop, with interior dimensions 2.56 x 3.94 x 4.72&#34; (6.5 x 10.0 x 12.0cm). I also use the Joby JB01271-PWW DSLR Wrist Strap which tucks right into the case along with the camera – plenty of room. The belt loop is strong and large enough for any size belt allowing it to ride very securely on your hip. I can also leave the strap hanging out the side of the case flap to become the wrist carry strap for both camera and case when not secured to my belt. No shoulder strap is included as your camera’s own shoulder strap would serve that purpose.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with this case is that while the storage pocket is large and ample enough to hold a couple spare batteries, etc., it doesn’t hold them very securely because it’s wide open on the top and the contents can easily slide out while taking the bag off your belt for example, thus I have previously only used it to hold a micro fiber lens cloth. A Velcro tab, snap, or better yet a zipper to secure the contents would have made it perfect for spare battery(s), memory card, etc.<br /><br />My solution was to stop by the local Tandy Leather Factory store where for $9 I purchased a pack of #1263-03 Line 24 Snaps/Black Plate, #8056-00 DOT/RIVET Anvil, and #8058-00 Line 24 Durable Dot Setter and attached two snaps with the help of my leather punch near the top seam of the pocket opening about 1.75” apart. Now the pocket remains securely closed and I am totally pleased with this case.r punch near the top seam of the pocket opening about 1.75” apart.

Likhith,5,Incredible!!,2014-06-27,N,I previously had the Panasonic dmc fz7 for over 10 years & i thought for sure that was the best camera ever made until the LX7 came along. I was blown away by photos i took the other day when compared with the FZ7. No comparison what so ever! I look for fine details in my pictures mostly in macro modes. The detail level is astonishing. Then i switched to video recording & played it back only to find that it was comparable to my Canon HF M300!! Pretty dang good for a point & shoot! I'm sure i'll learn more as time goes by. I've only had it a few days so far. Get this camera!!<br /><br />Update 7/1/14:  I almost forgot to mention that i had bought the highly praised Sony RX100 before buying the LX7 & i was highly disappointed! I tried some macro shots with & it would miss the subject i was trying to capture. It would only capture part of the image & leave the rest of it a blur (like the background was supposed to be). Also the video on the RX 100 was a joke it was so slow to focus that the subject would be gone by the time it got into focus!! But back to the LX7 this baby is a beast! I think i will only buy Panasonic cameras from here on out. No thanks Sony.,7,7,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3

One must put a lens cover over it...that doesn't work for me because I am always grabbing at my camera, pulling it in and out of its case.  I don't want to have to take the cover off, find a place to put the cover, and then remember to put it back on (the very first day, I misplaced the cover and couldn't find it for awhile!).<br /><br />Also disappointing was the video quality...ABSOLUTELY NO BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAMERA!.<br /><br />After doing a comparison shoot with my new camera and my old camera, the difference in quality was hardly noticeable.<br /><br />The flash on the camera is a pop up thing which is a little annoying...personally, I rather have the flash part of the camera base with the ability to select it in a menu.<br /><br />The top megapixal capability went down a little, which is OK but surprising for a newer more expensive camera..<br /><br />To be fair, there are more features on this camera than my old one, but all the above mentioned annoyances trumped the added features",15,0,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,4

Tech Thamilan,5,A superb camera,2014-06-11,Y,"I would like to give my opinion about the Lumix LX7 camera (referred wrongly by many as a point and shoot camera). I am an experienced amateur photographer, have owned many different cameras like Leicas, Hasselblad and Nikons from the film age. Presently I own a Pentax K30 with a wide assortment of lenses which I think is a fantastic camera, so I guess I know what I am talking about.<br />When you talk about digital cameras, there is a school of thought that puts a lot of emphasis on the pixel count, noise at the pixel level and comparisons based on many technical aspects with very little consideration about the actual results and their intended use. Let me clarify. I shoot my pictures for my pleasure and like to view and show them in a screen, with the occasional print of the ones a Ilke best of up to 20 inches in the largest dimension. And I guess that I am among a very large group of photographers in this respect. So, the intended use is of primary importance in my analysis.<br />My daughter is a professional photographer, so she uses full frame Nikons and Canons and her pictures have a different intended use, large prints among them. So, her analysis would be different from mine.<br />So, what do I look in a camera, given my needs? Let me make a list of requirements.<br />1. High quality<br />2. Good ergonomics<br />3. Wide angle<br />4. Low weight for casual photography and travel<br />5. Fast lens<br />6. Good zoom range<br />7. Sharp results<br />8. RAW capability<br />9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL<br />10. Good battery life<br />11. Reasonable price<br />12. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings<br />13. Eye level viewfinder<br />14. Fast focusing<br />15. Good screen for composing and viewing<br />16. Good movie capabilities<br /><br />Obviously, most of these requirements are met by a DSRL, like my Pentax K30, except perhaps and arguably by the movie capability which in this case is just adequate and the requirement of low weight. Any DSRL, including the Pentax are heavy and more so after a  day of carrying it, along with an assortment of lenses. But I needed a camera that, while satisfying all my requirements was both reasonable in size and weight and that not a pain in the neck (literally) to carry around and allowed me to be fairly inconspicuous while shooting.<br />After reviewing the available options, and I considered all the obvious ones, like the Sony RX100, the Canon S models and the high end Nikon compacts, it was obvious to me that the best alternative by far was the Panasonic LX7 for several reasons, in spite of being a model introduced 2 years ago.<br />Let me start with the end result and then I will cover the details and the reasons I opted for this camera. It is a fantastic camera of high quality build that gives excellent results and it’s a joy to use.<br />Now let me get into specifics. I will tackle my list of requirement individually, but my review will necessarily be limited to what I consider the relevant points.<br /><br />1. High quality<br /><br />The construction of this camera is flawless with a metal body. You can fell the quality as you hold it in your hands. Almost every review I have read about this camera has a negative opinion of the battery/SD card open latch, calling it flimsy and detracting from the general high quality construction. In my opinion this is a moot point as my experience with several point & shoot Panasonic cameras I have owned is that it works perfectly, and I believe that the reason Panasonic continues to use it is that it works and it is durable. This camera is built to last and at the same time is a thing of beauty that you are proud to own.<br /><br />2. Good ergonomics<br /><br />The camera feels just right in your hands, has an excellent grip to your right side that gives a good one handed hold on it. All the controls are in the right places, at least in my opinion, are easy to operate and secure in holding their position. You willnot move a control inadvertently, that’s for sure. One of the criticisms that are offered is that the lens cap has to be removed each time you turn on the camera. I personally, coming from the film era cameras find this totally natural and it doesn’t bother me at all. Anyhow, I have purchased an accessory lens cap, three leafed that opens automatically when you turn on the camera and that works beautifully. I alternate between these two lens covers, depending where I carry the camera. This one is an inexpensive gadget that can be bought at Amazon or eBay and it’s very easy to install or remove.<br />One word of caution: remember always to attach the small cord provided to secure the original lens cap to the camera body so to not loose it inadvertently.<br />I particularly liked the aperture control ring and the aspect ratio selection switch, both operating directly through the lens mount. Very convenient.<br /><br />3. Wide angle<br /><br />The lens has fantastic wide angle capabilities. The equivalent 35mm maximum is 24mm, but a would like to give a word of caution. These measures are used always in reference to an aspect ratio that is all right if you just crop the picture to give the aspect ratio you want. No so in the case of the LX7. The sensor has more pixels than the ones you get in the actual picture, and so, if you use the 3:2 ratio you get the 24mm coverage. But if you go to the 16:9 ratio, the LX7 takes away a portion of the upper and lower parts of the picture but adds to the left and right sides, so that what you get in this case is a coverage of almost 21mm. The same happens, in the opposite direction with the other aspect ratios available, 4:3 and 1:1. To my knowledge this is not provided by any other camera I know of.<br /><br />4. Low weight for casual photography and travel<br /><br />This camera is not tiny by any means, but neither it is unreasonable large and its weight is adequate to carry it all day long with no undue strain. I normally carry it in a case that is attached to my belt (I use the leather model that provides sturdy protection and it’s nice to look at) and always have it with me. Occasionally I can carry the camera on the pocket of my jacket. In this case I use the alternate lens cover that I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />5. Fast lens<br /><br />In this respect, the LX7 shines. It has the most luminous lens in the compact camera market, as far as I know. It has a maximum aperture of 1.4 at maximum aperture and 2.3 at its longest telephoto setting. All other cameras considered may have a good maximum aperture (though none comes near the 1.4) but the telephoto end is way over the 2.3 that the LX7 achieves. Just look at the specs of the LX7 competitors and you get the idea.<br /><br />6. Good zoom range<br /><br />The zoom range of the LX7 covers most of my shooting needs. I tend to use the wide angle settings more often than the telephoto, and there are some occasions where I need more than an 90mm equivalent range. For these cases (not very numerous for me) I am considering buying a long telephoto compact camera to carry around as a supplement, instead of my DSRL with a telephoto lens. The Panasonic range has some very good possibilities, with very sharp Leica lenses that will fit my bill. Consider this as having a very long zoom lens for your DSRL, and compare the size and weight. You get my point. If you consider cost and weight this is a no brainer.I believe this will be the way to go for me. You can carry the LX7 for most of your shooting and use the other compact camera for long range shooting at an acceptable level of quality when you need it.<br /><br />7. Sharp results<br /><br />The lens and sensor combination of the LX7 gives amazing results, even when shooting at full aperture. In all honesty, I can’t tell the difference between pictures taken with the LX7 and the Pentax. Probably I would see a difference in large prints but I don’t have the need for these. I believe this Leica Summilux zoom lens is among the sharpest lenses I have ever used.<br /><br />8. RAW capability<br /><br />The LX7 can shoot in both RAW and JPEG formats or both simultaneously. I shoot all my pictures in RAW and am able to extract full detail. Incidentally, the LX7 produces RAW files with a color depth of 16 bits, while my Pentax gives me RAW files with a color depth of 12 bits only. I cannot the tell the difference in my monitor or in the prints I have made. Probably this has importance for large professional work and in this particular respect the LX7 may have an advantage. I can extract good details from the light and dark areas, especially from the lights.<br /><br />9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL<br /><br />A good capability that the LX7 has is that you can use threaded 37mm filters. The only thing you need is an unexpensive adapter ring that is very easy to install. This is a very distinctive advantage that the LX7 has that I have not seen pointed out in most of the reviews I have read. The other big advantage it has is the incorporated neutral density filter that is built in the camera and can be used by the push of a dedicated button. Again, to my knowledge no other camera in this category has this capability.<br /><br />10. Reasonable price<br /><br />The LX7 also has a nice price advantage over most of its rivals, especially the Sony RX100 line. You can get it now in Amazon for around 340 dollares, although the price fluctuates and is a good idea to check it regularly. I bought mine in Amazon, used, like new, including a spare battery and case for around 220 dollars. It was in perfect condition and you can’t beat that price.<br /><br />11. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings<br /><br />I have found that noise is not a problem up to 800 ISO. The settings of 1600 and 3200 produced and amount of noise that could be managed nicely in post processing and for computer use and small prints ISO 6400 is adequate. In BW pictures, noise can be used to your advantage, giving that special grain look that you achieved using Kodak Tri X film.<br /><br />12. Eye level viewfinder<br /><br />Another of the critics I have found in the review is that the LX7  does not have an eye level viewfinder. In some cases it is not mentioned the existence of an electronic viewfinder, the LVF2, that is attached to the flash accessory shoe. I adds bulk to the camera (you can still pocket it in your jacket) and you can not use the case with it. But although is an expensive item, it is of very good quality, giving a very clear and detailed image that can be used in any circumstance, especially bright outdoors. It has the added advantage that it can be tilted up to 90 degrees, giving the possibility of waist level shooting. For me is a must have accessory.<br /><br />13. Fast focusing<br /><br />I have found that the focusing speed of the LX7 is nothing short of fantastic, even in low light, making this camera an excellent low light one in combination to its very fast lens. In this respect, it cannot be beaten, given the very sharp results you can get using its maximum aperture.<br /><br />14. Good screen for composing and viewing<br /><br />The screen is very good, with resolution over 900 K pixels, with good contrast and magnification when using it for viewing your pictures. The only thing I would have liked is a capability for tilting it. But I can live without it and the possibility of tilting the electronic viewfinder is a good substitute for it.<br /><br />I don’t have a need for filming in most instances, but in those moments I used the LX7 for filming I was surprised by the very high quality of the clips I obtained. But my thing is photography, so I cannot fully evaluate the capabilities of this camera in this respect to this.<br />I always thought that the camera is a tool for taking photographs, the more important component of a good photo being the photographer. But the better the tool you have the more you can take advantage of it to achieve better results. In this respects, the LX7 is a formidable tool, that gives the photographer most of the capabilities he or she might ever need. I am far from exhausting the possibilities that this gem of a camera provides and suspect that there are many that I will probably never use. I would give this camera a punctuation of 9.9 out of a possible 10 and highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.ux zoom lens is among the sharpest lenses I have ever used.<br /><br />8. RAW capability<br /><br />The LX7 can shoot in both RAW and JPEG formats or both simultaneously. I shoot all my pictures in RAW and am able to extract full detail. Incidentally, the LX7 produces RAW files with a color depth of 16 bits, while my Pentax gives me RAW files with a color depth of 12 bits only. I cannot the tell the difference in my monitor or in the prints I have made. Probably this has importance for large professional work and in this particular respect the LX7 may have an advantage. I can extract good details from the light and dark areas, especially from the lights.<br /><br />9. Use of optic filters, like an UV, Neutral or CPL<br /><br />A good capability that the LX7 has is that you can use threaded 37mm filters. The only thing you need is an unexpensive adapter ring that is very easy to install. This is a very distinctive advantage that the LX7 has that I have not seen pointed out in most of the reviews I have read. The other big advantage it has is the incorporated neutral density filter that is built in the camera and can be used by the push of a dedicated button. Again, to my knowledge no other camera in this category has this capability.<br /><br />10. Reasonable price<br /><br />The LX7 also has a nice price advantage over most of its rivals, especially the Sony RX100 line. You can get it now in Amazon for around 340 dollares, although the price fluctuates and is a good idea to check it regularly. I bought mine in Amazon, used, like new, including a spare battery and case for around 220 dollars. It was in perfect condition and you can’t beat that price.<br /><br />11. Moderate to low noise at high ISO settings<br /><br />I have found that noise is not a problem up to 800 ISO.

Abhishek,5,Great Camera,2014-06-10,Y,"This is an excellent alternative to my DSLR when I don't want to carry heavy gear with me. f/1.4 is pretty much unheard of on anything but a single-focal length lens that would cost more than this whole camera. Having access to all of the settings is awesome, most non-DSLR cameras force you to shoot in auto. Having a built-in ND filter is useful as well. Image quality is comparable to the Sony RX100 ii, which costs more than twice as much, and was my previous favorite compact camera. The only thing the Sony improves is having a viewfinder in addition to an LCD.",2,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3

Raju,5,excellent for low light,2014-06-06,Y,"Fast shooting, fast lens.<br />For low light, most cameras add a bigger CMOS chip and increase the ISO, but all that does is give you grainy photos. Most cameras have a 3.5, 2.8 lens. If you want to shoot in low light you need 1.8 or lower. These are impossible to find, except for this LX7 which has a 1.4 lens. Thats very fast. Indoor low light photos are now possible.<br />Also, this camera is 10MP, that is all you will ever need for prints up to 16&#34;x20&#34;. Many cameras keep adding MP which eats up your SD card space and will not give you better low light. (Always look at the front of the lens for the size, the LX7 will have 1: 1.4 - 2.3  They rarely put that info in the specs )<br />iAuto is good, so is Programmed settings. Low light capability is very good.<br />But the price is up $120 since last year. On Amazon, prices fluctuate. If you are not in a hurry to purchase you could hit at the right time and save. Price is up again for 2016. What is going on with this camera.?",3,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,1
KANNY,5,Excellent advanced compact,2014-06-05,Y,"This is a fantastic little camera that fits in a larger pocket, solidly made, with excellent bright lens and plenty of external controls.  The lens is extremely bright or fast if you will, you rarely need a flash which btw is very nice, totally under your control ( does not pop out unless you decide to release it).  Pictures are great without or with the flash.  You can change image size ration right on lens, there is a built in neutral density filter if you need to use slower shutter speeds but conditions are too bright.  It has very nice effect filters and scene modes or you can go with advanced modes or fully manual.  Either way it is hard not to take good pictures and I find myself using it a lot instead of my dSLR, especially when traveling.  Oh, and video quality is brilliant.  This camera is priced below the competitors and occasionally discounted on Amazon up to 98 $, which makes it basically a steal.  There is an external electronic viewfinder available that can be used in full sun conditions or just as a preference( Panasonic DMW-LVF2 External Live View Finder for DMC-GX1, DMC-LX7 Cameras).

G.v.narayana,5,Panasonic LX7,2014-05-15,Y,wonderful camera! my film cameras were getting to heavy for canoe tripping so after reading many reviews i got the LX7.<br /> the Leica lens was the best selling point as i have several Leica's and know the high quality of their work.<br /> the only draw back for me was working thru all the many-many things the camera could do.using Nikon for years it was just a speed and lens setting but the LX7 is one of those &#34;sings and dances&#34; modern cameras that leave old school guys like me behind the learning curve.the detail in the shots is mind blowing and once i had the easy set ups done i left it like that and just shot away.<br />  when i have time i'll work on more detail settings. you need to keep this camera clean!.the tele tab got a bit sticky so next trip i'll take a small brush.,2,0,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3

Manas Ranjan Sethi,5,Love the camera; probably gets a 4.5,2014-05-10,Y,"I absolutely love the camera. It was recommended by my daughter-in-law who takes photos of her fast moving children.  I am a basic point and shoot kind of photographer, but I love great photos mostly to document trips and family.<br /><br />What I like the most:  I love the fast shutter speed.  I rarely use the flash and hardly ever have fuzzy photos from moving targets.  It is light weight and easy to carry. There is a rechargeable Li battery and charger included.  I think that the camera is a great value.<br /><br />Things that could be better:<br />1) I wish that there was an automatic lens cap.  Based on a review, I ordered the Goya auto lens cap for &lt; $10 but couldn't figure where the lens ring was to remove to put on the auto lens cap.  Panasonic's service was significantly less than optimal. I spent > 1 hour on the Panasonic website trying to figure out where the lens ring was.  Then I spent more time with the on-line chat only to have him/her tell me that it didn't exist (it does).  I e mailed Goya and got a fairly prompt response with a link to a YouTube video ([...]) that showed how to remove the lens ring.  (I'm not quite sure why this information wasn't included with the auto lens cap.)  The lens cap then installed easily.  It is SO much easier to have this auto lens cap that to take the Panasonic lens cap off, leave it hanging on its string, and replacing it when I'm done.<br />2) There is no view finder.  This hasn't been a problem so far, but on my last Canon camera, when I was in the rain forest in Costa Rica looking at white faced Capuchin monkeys, I could see them on the LED in the dappled light but they were visible with the view finder.<br />3) There is no wi-fi connection that many other cameras now have.  However, plugging the camera into my Mac's USB port after downloading Silkypix onto the computer was very simple.<br /><br />I have a friend that has a &lt;1 year old Panasonic point and shoot that cost her over $100 more than mine and she now has camera envy.  I chose wisely.now has camera envy.  I chose wisely.",4,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,5
Tejas,5,Best small camera I have ever owned.,2014-05-08,Y,"I am thoroughly impressed with every aspect of this camera, and I was lucky enough to have purchased it on a VERY bizarre and VERY temporary 2 day $100 price drop from $398 to $298... Watch the new and used prices on this camera. It yoyo's UP and DOWN significantly. As I write this, the price went back UP to $347 from $298... and $398 - all in the same week! lucky me. The one additional odd thing I noticed was a blue 'fog' when shooting into direct sunlight. Probably the lens coating. Something to watch out for when zoomed out. This 'purple haze' spot can be reduced by angling the camera slightly up, down, or sideways. This camera has more functions and features than my Canon 5D Mark iii, costing thousands more. Optics are excellent. READ THE MANUAL. There is a LOT going on inside this baby!",3,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3
Himanshu gupta,2,"Rating is for Manual, Not the Camera",2014-04-28,N,"Panasonic must assume everyone already owned the previous Lumix model so it would just be a little bit of a tweak to move up to the LX7.  Not me:  I previously used a Zeiss Contaflex, Leica p/s and a Nikon, but all of them use film.  I can't lug rolls and rolls of film in my carry on when I go to Europe, thus I bought this one on the basis of the Leica lens.  So now I'm into the manual and its atrocious.  The photos I've taken just using iA are beautiful, but I'd like to use more of the features and am stymied by this horrible manual.  Having spent numerous hours pursuing clarification of terms and buttons I didn't have on my other cameras I just came across a most promising Kindle book dealing with the LX7.  While grateful to have thought of looking on Amazon, finding this book also infuriated me even more.  All Panasonic had to do was write a lead-in paragraph or two to introduce each topic or even construct a flow-diagram (a what???), but no, all they did was to produce this jumbled, disorganized, unorganized, disjointed mess covering 250+ pages.<br /><br />My advice to anyone buying this camera is to buy the Kindle book at the same time.  Never mind about the viewfinder, the camera bag, the tripod, the extra flash, blah blah.  If you can't make head nor tail of the manual, you'll be confined to iA -- and that is an injustice to the camera.<br /><br />A week or so later:  I have Alexander S. White's \\""Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX7\\"" on my Kindle and then saw that it also comes in book form so I ordered that, too.  I decided that trying to read the Photographer's Guide on my Kindle was going to mean charging the Kindle every night, and that meant not having the Kindle available for my evening read.  In addition:  it means I will have the Photographer's Guide with me when I travel.  Sometimes I am just in a state of wonderment at how lucky we are to have all of this technology available.<br /><br />Later still:  I have already ordered a wrist strap and a self-operating lens cap.  I had too many straps, etc. interfering and getting in the way when I was trying to take a picture.  The neck strap really got in the way and took up too much room in the camera bag and got all tangled up - and then I had hooked the lens cap to the neck strap so a nuisance all way around.  I've already attached the lens cap:  stuck my hand in a rubber glove and unscrewed the retainer ring.  No problem at all, but still have to see if some of the reviewers' comments about the lens cap mean it's going to be a problem.  Another note:  I also bought a viewfinder and have yet to figure out where to put the hotshoe so that I don't lose it.<br /><br />Given all of the additions I've ordered the cost of the camera has gone up.  A prospective buyer might want to think about that when making comparisons to other cameras.and a self-operating lens cap.

Anil Kumar,5,Best compact camera for balance of features & price,2014-04-25,Y,"I have tried out several different compact cameras, including the Sony RX100, and settled on the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 for several reasons. First, here's what I was looking for in a compact camera:<br /><br />- Fast aperture (f2.8 or better)<br />- Low time to first photo and fast recycle time (even if not &#34;burst&#34; mode)<br />- Custom aperture and shutter controls<br />- 1080 video<br /><br />Both the Sony RX100 and the LX7 meet those requirements, but the LX7 is $150 cheaper. I actually picked mine up for $369 and saved almost $200 off the price of the RX100.<br /><br />I had the Panasonic LX5 a few years ago and really loved it, so I was already comfortable with the controls and menu. It's just a great little camera and I take it EVERYWHERE with me. Anywhere I don't lug my big Nikon DSLR, I have my LX7.<br /><br />Couldn't be happier with the size, image quality, or performance so far. And it's really durable... I just throw it in my bag or pocket and go. So far, the aluminum body has resisted scratches and dings well.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good compact camera with advanced features and a fast aperture, the LX7 is a great choice.",4,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3
Jyothi,5,Premium compact at a cracking price,2014-04-24,N,"The LX-7 has been out a while now (it came out late 2012 and the price has fallen significantly as expected)<br />Fast forward to 2014 and there is a newer model out (but with a much larger sensor and a heavy ish price) However this still stacks up very well and worthy of some attention.<br /><br />I've used the LX-7 for a few weeks (borrowed from a friend) and I feel it's a very decent (though by no means perfect) good quality compact. You just don't normally get this kind of camera at a price like this, so with that in mind I will do a quick summary of my good and bad points<br /><br />Bottom line, grab yourself a bargain!<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Nice fast 24-90mm (equivalent) f1.4-2.3 lens (this is much faster than many compacts)<br />+ Good build overall feels solid and well made<br />+ Excellent clear, high resolution 920k 3&#34; LCD<br />+ Aperture ring on the lens<br />+ Good image quality for a 1/1.7&#34; sensor<br />+ Shoots raw<br />+ Extensive number of burst shooting modes up to 11fps and a decent buffer too (about 11-12 shots raw) There are a lot of burst shooting modes (you will see some market with AF - Autofocus - some without though)<br />+ You can store custom settings on the main exposure dial (C1 and C2 very handy)<br />+ Aspect ratio switch (no need to menu dive)<br />+ Fast and responsive with good AF performance<br />+ Option to add viewfinder (EVF)<br />+ Lots of features, full manual controls, bracketing, tons of scene modes, electronic level pretty much &#34;fully loaded)<br />+ Time lapse and multi exposure modes (I don't use these much but they are nice to have)<br />+ HD video 1080@60p very good well defined video with stereo sound. You can use the zoom and AF as well.<br />+ OIS works well around 3.5-4 stops<br />+ Built in ND filter allows faster apertures in bright light<br />+ Sensible and logical menus and controls (the quick menu is ok but can't be customised)<br />+ Has a hot shoe<br />+ Excellent macro mode (captures an area about an inch square, that pretty close)<br />+ Pretty good battery life I got around 320 shots per charge (I'd get a spare though)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Limited zoom range 3.8x (just 90mm at the telephoto end)<br />- No built in viewfinder (I like them some don't care)<br />- Dynamic range improved v the LX-5 but can still clip highlights<br />- Slow buffer clearing times - even with a fast Sandisk 45MB/s card<br />- Jpeg noise reduction can be turned down (to -2) but I would prefer less smoothing on jpegs<br />- Quick menu could be better<br />- Intelligent zoom compromises image quality (I'd simply crop images myself)<br />- Lens zooming a tad slow speed wise<br />- AWB (auto white balance) a bit cool for daylight shots (adjust in camera or post)<br />- No wifi or GPS (GPS would be handy) not a huge loss though<br />- Panoramic mode could be better results wise (I would stitch them at home on the pc)<br /><br />When the LX-7 came out there was mixed reaction as the company had decided to go with a slightly smaller sensor over the LX-5 (1/1.7&#34; v 1/1.63&#34;) But there are some important improvements and even for LX-5 users it might be worth a look.<br /><br />** v the LX-5**<br />The lens is much faster F1.4 - F2.3 (v F2.0 - F3.3)<br />You get a built in ND filter, and the new on lens aperture ring (shame it can't be customised though)<br />920k v 430k LCD screen<br />Electronic level, HDR mode, time lapse, much faster burst modes<br />A new MOS sensor v the older CCD one (seems to be better with dynamic range)<br />Full HD stereo video the older 720p mono on the LX-5<br /><br />The only real area where the LX-5 is better is battery life (but I found it fine on the LX-7)<br />It's quite a strong update over the previous model in my view<br /><br />In terms of low light performance, the key here is the lens speed which is very fast (and faster than rivals)<br />This means you will be able to keep the ISO levels down even in lower light. It's a trade off you havea smaller sensor but a faster lens. So for dim shooting the camera does well, you're unlikely to need to raise the ISO to ISO 1600.<br /><br />In good light I think the larger 2/3&#34; sensors do have somewhat better definition at lower ISO levels. The Fuji's I've used seem to do better here (the LX-7 still does well though) and they edge the Panasonic out for dynamic range too (but it's much improved v the LX-5 in my view)<br /><br />At the original asking price there are a few nitpicks, maybe you might ponder if this is for you and look around at the Canon G's or S models or the Fuji X ones.<br /><br />But with this new bargain price right now, well to be honest new model or not on the horizon this is well worth considering. It's a steal really...this is a very nice well featured camera that has a good lens and does well even in low light. It's a serious compact for users who want to get their teeth into photography more.<br /><br />Recommended, 4 star camera at a 5 star price so I'll give it 5 overalla smaller sensor but a faster lens.

Basically, I was looking for a good travel camera that should be compact, with wide angle lens and the possibility to not use flash (I confess, I don't know how to use flash properly). I've read all comparisons between the RX100 and LX7, and I ended up buying this because of the price (USD 320 in Sept2013....half of the price of the RX100). I have to say, this camera is absolutely amazing. I've read many good things about the fact it has a bright an excellent f1.4 lens, but I didn't know how this would be in real shooting. The way this stuff handles low light is awesome. Pictures are sharp with low noise and beautiful color rendition. I shoot in JPG and RAW, but the JPGs are beautiful straight out of the camera. To get the same results in low light with a CSC, you would need to spend extra money with a prime lens. This is exactly what I'm doing right now with my new NEX 3N. Movies are excellent and pictures in daylight are incredible.<br />It focus really fast...you won't miss a shot with the way this thing focus even in low light. It has manual controls for WB, ISO, focal lenght, EV and an extra Fn button. The only thing that might be a problem for some is the effective resolution of this camera that might compromise big printings. Don't bother with the lens cap and buy those auto lens cap (http://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Protector-MagicFiber-Microfiber-Cleaning/dp/B009OOBSH2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396639259&sr=8-1&keywords=lx7+lens+cap). I don't know how this thing compares to the NEX3n. I will do an update here as soon as I test the NEX.",2,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,5
rajina. m,5,Great camera for the quality point&shoot enthusiast.,2014-04-01,Y,"I purchased a Canon S95 a few years back, to use it for work and home photography, and loved the portability of the small camera body, plus the manual controls, but was needing a camera with better low light capabilities than my Canon's F2.0 max aperture, and after much online reading, purchased the Panasonic DMC-LX7.<br /><br />The low light capabilities of the LX7 are amazing, with the F1.4 max aperture of the lens, I can take a side by side picture of an almost dark room with no flash, and the Canon's picture is dim and grainy, but the LX7's picture almost looks like there is a 25 watt bulb on in the room, and the ISO noise is relatively low.<br /><br />The LX7 is obviously a larger and heavier camera than the Canon offerings, but that is a logical tradeoff for a camera with these capabilities, when you consider the closest competition from Canon or Sony are hundreds of $ more expensive.<br /><br />The macro capabilities of the LX7 are also excellent, as I photograph engine parts up close at work, and can get as close as 1cm, and still have crystal clear focus, I cannot ask for more from a point and shoot.<br /><br />I have plenty to learn about the many functions and features this camera has, but at this time, and right out of the box, I believe I made a great choice, even though it is close to being discontinued, with rumors of an LX8 in the horizon.",4,4,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,2

Vivek rathore,5,What a wonderful camera!,2014-03-17,Y,"It has so many features, there is no limit to what you can do with this.  Outdoor shots at night in almost total darkness come out super, and that's handheld, no tripod!  Multiple exposure allows for some unique portraits!  I can't believe how well the camera makes handheld shots at even 1/4 second come out so sharp.  The lenes is it's major selling point, takes me back to the days of my 35mm SLR cameras and those huge lenses with the razor sharp F 1:4!!!  The lens keeps it from fitting into your shirt pocket, but overall the camera is still very compact and easy to carry.  If you do a lot of shots outside get the add-on electronic viewfinder because as with all other rear display viewfinders, it gets hard to see in direct sunlight.  I've had it a good while now, and am as excited about it as when I got it, if not more.  I keep learning about yet another unique feature this camera has just about every time I use it.

This is the perfect camera for those who hate that 'wash out' look.  It's nice to have a flash option but it's even better to do without and just get that natural color look in dim settings.

manik888,5,Excellent upgrade,2014-03-02,Y,"I've used a predecessor to this camera, the LX-3 for a few years as my pocket camera, something with very good image quality and higher-end functionality in a compact form that I tend to take with me when I'm out and about rather than having to make the decision to pack a bigger camera like a bridge or an SLR.<br /><br /> An important feature and the major reason I decided to upgrade was the LX-7's excellent low-light capability based around its best-in-class f1.4 lens. I've used the LX-3 indoors without distracting and face-flattening flash to good effect but the LX-7's lens has another aperture stop i.e. twice the light grasp so I expect it to do even better.<br /><br /> The LX-7 generally has more features than the older LX-3 but I've not investigated them too deeply yet. I've left the LX-3 on Auto setting most of the time and I don't expect to push the envelope technically speaking with the LX-7 but it's nice to have those extra functions (HDR etc.) if I do need them.",2,1,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,1

Sony's are my second choice for the same reason, the one's I have purchased have lasted a long time, in fact I don't think I ever had to retire one due to it not working but only because I wished to upgrade.<br /><br />So that said, it looked like this camera met my criteria.

Sangeetha jayakumar,4,Good compact camera - not as good as a DSLR,2014-02-02,N,"What I would add to the already complete reviews is that in making my buying decision (LX7 vs. RX100) I looked at a lot of images, shared here on Amazon, on DPReview and on Panansonic's own website. There are 2 things I look for in a camera: 1) sharpness and 2) ability to make beautiful pictures. Everything about a camera (maximum aperture, image processing, lens) contribute to both qualities.<br /><br />1) Sharpness. Images from the LX7 are sharp but noticeably less sharp than those of the RX100. I think a number of factors each contribute slightly to this. The 10mp is the first. The next is the lens seems to have slightly less resolution and contrast. The sensor size is very small, much smaller than that of the RX100. I think this adds a small amount of noise to the images. These are the LX7's disadvantages when compared to the RX100, or I should say the RX100's advantages over the LX7.<br /><br />2) Beauty. It is in the eye of the beholder. When I compare the images of the LX7 and the RX100 the ones from the RX100 just look better to me. Not only are they crisper the colors are more lifelike. Perhaps &#34;lifelike&#34; is the best way to describe it. It's the complex interplay of all factors which results in images that look great. The larger sensor size of the RX 100 also makes it capable of shorter depth of field, allowing its F1.8 to knock the background out of focus better than the LX7's F1.4.<br /><br />The RX100 has clear advantages over the LX7, however it costs a lot more. Ultimately, I bought the LX7.<br /><br />I needed something small and light that I can carry around and also something convenient for indoor use at home. For travel I often need something capable of low light photography and something a bit wider, and the LX7 serves that purpose. For home use I often need something I can just whip out to photograph a fleeting moment, whereas my NEX-7 usually has some lens on it that I have to swap out.",11,7,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,3

Srikanth,4,A very good choice,2014-01-20,Y,"I'm not sure it's fair to categorize this camera as a point and shoot.  I've had a few advanced point and shoots over the years and the LX7 is the best of them by far. It is very good in low light, so it takes much better indoor pictures than almost all compact cameras, primarily due to it's very fast lens.  That makes a huge difference.  The other area it excels is minimal shutter lag.  It captures and shoots much faster than any other camera I've used, so if photographing kids is your thing, it's a very good choice. The LX7 can be operated simply or manually, with more options than anyone will ever use, and the interface is pretty simple and intuitive.  It feels like a quality camera and responds like one.<br /><br />So why four stars? Tradeoffs.  It's not a DSLR and it can't match image quality with advanced interchangeable lense cameras. So if you are interested in making huge prints, there are better choices.  Additionally, zoom is limited compared to all of the powerful zooms that are available.  What makes the LX7 a good choice and nearly a perfect camera is that it is small, takes very good pictures, is fast, does well indoors,takes good video, has loads of features and can be had for under $300.  I searched for a long time and found it to the best reasonably priced camera for my needs.

I really like their lenses, but that's about it. As a disclaimer, I normally shoot with a Canon 6D DSLR, so this review may come off a bit harsh. I was also once the owner of the Panasonic DMC-LX5 after reading rave reviews, and after a month of shooting with it, ended up selling it due to some nagging aliasing and performance issues I couldn't get over. After seeing the LX7 on Amazon's lightning deals, I decided to pick up the latest iteration because it was quite affordable compared to when I purchased the LX5 for $500. But once again, it fell short of my expectations, and even at a low price-point, I just couldn't get myself to keep it.<br /><br />First, the good stuff.<br /><br />The lens is amazingly bright, fast, and sharp. During daylight situations, it's snappy and does the job well. You can get literally within inches of a subject and get a clean macro shot. The bokeh has a nice effect and overall, I'm still very impressed with the optics on the LX series.<br /><br />I'd say one of the neatest features is that you can change the aspect ration on the fly and it maintains the full megapixels. It's definitely useful in this day and age with people who love uploading to Insta.<br /><br />Now for the bad.<br /><br />It's unfair for me to compare this to my DSLR, but hey, a good compact in my opinion, can keep up with decent DSLRS, especially when it's boasting a superfast lens. I love to shoot photography without flash but I'm sorry to say that I've missed too many opportunities due not necessarily because of the lens, but because of the focusing. The focusing on the camera in low-light, even with the af assist beam, tends to drag out a bit and I missed many good moments because of it.<br /><br />After a while, you begin to cope with the a/f issues and even then, the pictures for whatever reason just don't come out as nice as I hoped under low-light conditions. The ISO gets very noisy after 3200 and eventually gave up and popped the flash.<br /><br />I think if the flash performance was decent, I would've kept it, but this was the deal breaker for me.<br /><br />The flash is almost pointless. I didn't get into researching on how the flash compensates for itself, but by default, it didn't do a great job. It would either come out over exposed or underexposed in most situations. Granted you can always change the flash power settings in the menu, but nobody got time for that...<br /><br />Not to mention it has issues with Red-eye, even though it claims to prevent red-eye. It's just not cool...<br /><br />At the end of the day, I felt like the overall picture quality was the same from what I remember with the LX5. I was really hoping they'd push the envelope with high-end point and shoots, but I ended up returning the LX7 before our return period. Other than the price, I was absolutely disappointed. The potential is there, but the sensor just felt like the same stuff they had in the LX5.<br /><br />In any case, if you don't care for low-light photography and are looking for a good or even great point and shoot at a low price point, this might be your best bet. It can shoot raw and the lens is bar none one of the best among point and shoots. Too bad the sensor and software can't say the same. Leica does an amazing job with the optics, but Panasonic needs to step up their game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.ight conditions.

Aashish Dixit,5,Great little camera.,2014-01-04,Y,"There are many technical reviews out there that detail how this camera stacks up to comparable models, but my reasons for getting this camera were not that sophisticated. I've just started using this camera, and I'm still discovering tons of new features so this review is based on my first experiences.<br />What I like:<br />1. Compact (i.e. lightweight) - I used the flimsy shoulder strap it came with and had the camera slung over my shoulder (diagonally across my chest) for over 3 hours and didn't mind the weight.<br />2. Good in low light - This is a tricky one since what one considers low light may be quite different. Most of my low light situations have been indoors with a weak overhead light or a lamp in the corner. I pushed my luck with some of my pictures where there just wasn't enough light for my subject, and I got a little blur. Not the fault of the camera. You just need to be realistic about what the camera will do.<br />3. Stereo sound - Yeah I know, that's like being excited about being able to make a call with a smart phone. I've been using a lot of point-n-shoots that had mono sound that was horrible. This is so much better.<br />What I'm not as thrilled about:<br />1. The lens cap - I don't expect it to automatically open. I'm used to lens caps on my dslr and other point-n-shoots. My main gripe is that it so dang small and is even smaller than the lens diameter. My hands are average size, probably more slender than average dudes, but I still struggle with getting the lens cap off and on. If you have big hands, I pity you.<br />2. The manual focus - Here's where I probably should have done more research. I'm used to flipping a switch on a lens to the &#34;MF&#34; setting then grabbing the lens ring and focusing away. This camera is a quite a bit different. It's not necessarily bad... just different, and I find myself struggling to learn a whole new way of focusing with buttons. I'll probably just need to practice.<br />Final Conclusion: For the price, this is a great camera. You get the convenience of a point-n-shoot with all kinds of features and modes for those who like to customize and control their camera. You'll want to check out the manual as a pdf file so you can jump around to all the links. Don't print the pdf file as a hard copy.

It's not on par with even cheap DSLR though. So for the price I would have given 5 stars. But just after one year, one year and a week, after the warranty expired, the sensor does not work any more.

Axn,5,Great performance in a compact package,2013-12-29,Y,"I purchased the Lumix for work on film sets.  I needed a camera that could handle low-light situations and take quality photos while still being small enough to fit on my tool belt.  This camera fits the bill perfectly.  Whether I need to photograph a set for my portfolio, or I'm taking continuity shots from the monitor, it performs perfectly.  I also love the battery life, often going a couple of (12) hour days without having to charge up.<br /><br />The shooting speed, size, and range of options make this a great camera for people who need a semi-pro compact or to capture everyday moments.

Nayeem,5,great compact camera,2013-12-29,Y,"Whats all the complaining about the lens cap about? It appears most people have only used point and shoot with the plastic shutters over the lens. Those things are the most likely to need repaired of any part of the camera, that came from a sales person at a camera store in a large city close to here. Real cameras use lens caps. The LX7 is a fine camera and all these long reviews comparing camera A to camera B , bitching about this and that is so boring and useless. So what if there are small differences, if you enjoy what you have BE HAPPY. Cameras used to be optical instruments , nowdays they are more electronic appliances.  Just think, the LX7 will be replaced soon along with every other toy and all you over active Amazon reviewers will have to do your thing all over again. OH YEAH , I do own a LX7 and i like it.

Mahendra khurra,5,UNBELIEVABLE POINT AND SHOOT,2013-12-28,N,"My research paid off!  This camera compares with $800 dollar cameras. It has features that $1300 cameras don't have. I was choosing amongst 6 different cameras that I thought were comparable point and shoot models.  Not often that the least expensive model gets my attention, but this camera is a blast to use.  There may be a feature or two that was missing, but it was hard to pass up the lens of this camera, probably best in its class.  Brightest, meaning fastest lens, Leica lens.  I found a video that was excellently done on a review site for this camera.  It stated it very clearly, that using the intellligent auto mode was the worse thing you could do with this camera, taking indoor shots that were not desirable.  The video shows you how to set up this camera properly, with a one time setup, taking advantage of the fast lens eliminating picture blur and eliminating any red eye as well because you rarely need to use the flash and shutter speed is much faster if set up properly.  The macro mode is stunning, best in class easily.  I followed the video easily with a one time setup and now my wife can shoot this camera like a pro and she doesn't even have to access the menu.  After this one time setup, I don't know if there is an easier camera to use.

Pathan Majid khan,5,This is it.,2013-12-28,N,"After years of lugging around a heavy Pentax DSLR, with boulder-like lenses, I decided: enough. I'm not Ansel Adams. I'm a casual vacation photographer. Do I really want to have to carry another heavy bag through airport security?  After scanning lots of reviews -- from CNET, dpreview, and others, including Amazon—I decided to trade in my big DSLR for this Lumix LX7.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Everything you've heard is true: this little sucker delivers. Outstanding glass (it's Leica, after all), superb user interface, excellent portability. And the results?  Jaw-dropping.  The camera excels at macro—some shots of Christmas ornaments this year could be a Christmas card next year—and it's easy to achieve the pleasing \\""blurred background\\"" or \\""bokeh\\"" on many snapshots, thanks to the fast 1.4 lens. This little baby drinks in so much light, I haven't even tried (or needed) to use the flash.  It's just that good.<br /><br />I wish the lens were a little longer—3.8x is on the skimpy side—but if you learn how to use your feet, and how to crop and enlarge on your computer, you'll be pleased.<br /><br />And, as someone else has mentioned, use this video to get more oomph from the camera:<br /><br /> [...]<br /><br />I'm a happy camper.

Neeraj,5,Bought an LX7 and a Sony RX-100. Kept the LX7.,2013-12-01,Y,"I was looking for a smaller camera to supplement my Micro 4/3 system. I could not decide between the 10M pixel LX7 and the 20M pixel Sony RX-100. So, I got both to try. Ended keeping (and loving) the LX7. Ended up not liking (and selling) the RX-100,<br /><br />I purchased the LX7 with the excellent LVF-2 viewfinder. (As much as I have tried, for me, relying on the rear screen of a camera is a very poor substitute for having a first-class eye level viewfinder.)<br /><br />This is a really engaging camera to use. I am using it much more than I thought I would.<br /><br />I particularly like having the lens aperture and the aspect ratio control on the rings around the lens. (Unlike most digital cameras, the LX7 maximizes the available sensor real estate for each aspect ratio rather than cropping everything down from the native 4:3 ratio. So, you do find yourself changing the aspect ratio to suit the particular picture you are taking.)<br /><br />Image quality is much better than I expected from a small 10 M pixel sensor. Actually, surprisingly good.<br /><br />I got better fine detail resolution from the Sony RX-100, but the Sony was fiddlely to use and the Sony JPEG colors were simply too cool — something I was never able to properly correct in post processing. When I compared pics of the same subject side-by-side, I always preferred the pics from the LX7.<br /><br />I greatly preferred to use the LX7, and the LX7 plus finder cost less than the RX-100.<br /><br />I ended up never using the RX-100.

I have no problem with the lens cap that some have complained about.  Watch out for after market ones as they let a lot of dust in.  I'd like a 10X zoom but will live without it for the fast lens.  I have other cameras that will handle that task anyway.  I got the DMW-LVF2 electronic viewfinder which is great for eyes like mine that use close up lenses.  I use the pair together all the time now.  The camera fits in my pants pocket at least temporarily, although I wouldn't want to carry it there all day.  There is not much separation between the two shutter release steps.  I have to touch the shutter release very lightly to focus, then press fully to snap the picture.  Sometimes it takes the picture before I'm ready but I'll get used to it.  I recommend it and would buy it again.

However, for those occasions that a low light performance is of highest priority (i.e. in a museum) I would recommend investing the $400 difference in a fast prime lens (50mm f1.4) for a DSLR or outright buy an entry level DSLR with kit lens (Nikon D3100 or Canon T3).",4,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,2

I found all that in LX7, bar-none the best camera around for the price vs. features and image/built quality! It's not a plastic toy, that's for sure.<br /><br />Let me tell you something... if a camera gets its biggest complain from it's \\""hanging\\"" lens cap, that should say a lot about the overall quality of it.<br /><br />Here are the complains about this camera that I read here and other places...<br />1-Lens cap... thank God for the Auto Lens Cover (I got one too), but I would NOT have any complains using the cap came with it... just like on DSLR cameras.<br />2-Sensor size... Really? With F1.4 lens, I would give a rat's rear end for the sensor size... It gives perfect results and that counts for me the most.<br />3-Slow zoom in/out... Ok, go somewhere else then. It sure is slow and I am not making an Oscar winning movie with it... so I don't really care. Again, fast... I mean FAST focusing just makes up that \\""slow\\"" zooming!!!<br />4-No viewfinder! Sold separately... I confess, I tried to get closer to this camera a few times, thinking there is one... and little weird to take photos looking at the LCD screen, but not a big deal!<br />5-Only 24-90mm zoom! Again... really? some of the compact cameras sold more than $1K have prime lenses, either 35mm, 50mm... etc. which, none of them as fast as F1.4.<br /><br />There are more complains, but they are there practically just to complain about something, nothing else.<br /><br />So, in short... If you are/were a pro photographer... or not, and want a camera that will get you perfect photos, with or without total manual settings... this is your machine. Check out my sample pictures. I finally uploaded some that this camera deserves.<br /><br />PS: Video quality is superb... I and really LOVE the fast recording option which shows slow motion actions... pretty cool :)tures.

Khalid ansari,5,Dazzling Images from a Fabulous Camera,2013-11-13,Y,"I decided I did not want to take my full size DSLR on long motorcycle ride thru Latin America.  After much research I decided the Panasonic LX-7I was the perfect choice!  With its 7X zoom and full featured functionality, this camera will still fit easily into a jacket pocket.<br /><br />Numerous people have written excellent reviews full of technical facts about this camera-not gonna do that.  I will say that in typical Lumix fashion, images are sharp, vivid and dynamic throughout the range of the camera.  I am not a professional photographer, but the &#34;oh wow!&#34; factor is here, especially with the camera's Zeiss glass and ability to use full manual controls.<br /><br />Battery life is excellent; I was able to shoot over 400 images a day before needing to recharge.  Ergonomically, this unit fit my large hands (size ten gloves) very well; I never felt in danger of dropping it during ordinary handling.  In addition, I found the controls to be laid out logically.  I also liked the aperture ring for easy aperture priority shooting.<br /><br />The only possible nit could be the camera's ability to handle humidity and moisture…In my experience this was NOT an issue.  My LX-7 lived in a motorcycle tank bag for six weeks.  I dodged two hurricanes and shot hundreds of images on the  hot and muggy beaches of southern Mexico.  I never had a problem-now I'm back and the LX-7 continues to operate reliably and smoothly.<br /><br />There are many &#34;advanced&#34; digital cameras out there, so do your research.  The Sony RX series was a contender, as was the Canon G15.  For me, the LX-7, with its full suite of manual controls and preset options was a fabulous choice, at half the price of the Sony.  Feel free to email me if you have specific questions about the LX-7-happy to help as best I can!",4,4,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,5

Amazon Customer,3,Beautiful shots - compatibility issues,2013-11-03,Y,I would love to give this camera 5 stars.  It is solidly built and feels good in the hand.  The photos are excellent and I'm sure that if you knew what you were doing you could take some amazing shots with it.  This is a really good little camera for the price.  I prefer it to my more expensive Nikon for taking photos.  I am no photographer so I struggle with the settings.  What I am frustrated with are some of the compatibility issues for movies.  It takes really nice video.  Better than my Sony movie camera which is ancient granted but for a compact sized camera the movie quality is really nice.  However......I have a brand new MacBook Pro.  A very nice computer.  Unfortunately my very nice camera and my very nice computer hate each other!!!!  They aren't speaking at all.  My computer pretends as if my camera doesn't exist.  It completely ignores the files of movies that I have taken.  I looked into it and apparently Mac doesn't recognize AVCHD and the Panasonic insists that this is the way to go.  I downloaded and paid for a AVCHD converter.  I had never heard of this before but figured I would need this to convert the files in my camera.  The program looks simple enough.  Drag and drop file to convert it.  That would be swell if the Mac actually recognized the file.  Now I am no computer psychologist but these two just really don't seem to want to get along.  No nasty messages about compatibility.  It's just a flat out refusal to recognize the others existence.  My Lumix did have a better relationship with my old Mac but that went kaput.  It wasn't an easy relationship but at least the would communicate with a translator.  It's very frustrating to have all these lovely movies on a camera that you can't use.  It may be possible that there is a way around this if you are more camera and computer savy.  If you aren't you may want to wait and see if they decide to make this more compatible with your Mac.,10,3,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,1
Mallikarjuna,4,"Excels indoors, but too heavy and too little zoom to be my only camera",2013-11-02,Y,"This camera excels in low light, and takes excellent indoor photographs with no flash. I've got some lovely pictures with it. Outdoors, it's nothing particularly special, and the short (and slow!) zoom is a bit of a handicap -- on a trip to the zoo, I really felt the lack of zoom.<br /><br />Portability-wise, the LX7 is fairly large for a compact, but does fit in my man-sized trouser pockets or a jacket; you may want a hip case for it, or to slip it into a purse.<br /><br />Having bought this camera as a complement to my iPhone (as it has a little zoom, and indoor pictures that best any cellphone and most compact cameras handily), I'm very happy indeed.

Amit das,5,Best camera for me,2013-11-01,Y,"This is the best camera for my needs!  Great image quality for landscapes and buildings; amazing low-light pictures (really, amazing hand-held night shot mode); lots of creative modes or just put it on i-automatic and trust the shot will be good; don't miss an action shot with up to 11 frames / second - wow that's so fast I actually use just 5 FPS most of the time; It has a few high end features that I don't use like RAW mode and the flash hot-shoe;  I've used it indoors (no flash as I don't like flash shots), in a dark church or at birthday parties indoors with the kids for great results; most impressive results so far were night-time action in shutter priority mode to freeze the action and it still came through with its fast lens and 1600 ISO - and the images were good!; the only downside is the 3x zoom, but that's a trade-off for the pocketable size, large sensor, and cost-savings of not buying multiple lenses.  Really a great handy, usable, versatile camera with good battery life, ability to stick on a UV lens protector (big plus for me), not heavy so it comes along everywhere.  Oh, and great image quality all at an affordable price.  The aperture ring is handy as I use A-priority mode about half the time; the built in ND is awesome if you're experienced enough to know when to use it; I don't get much value from the aspect ratios as I crop afterward anyway; video is good but I don't use it much; and did I mention it's small enough that you'll actually bring it along and not mind the weight?  Ok, I've missed the viewfinder a couple of times in bright sun, but you can't have everything.  My next camera could be a GF5 for it's four thirds sensor;  as a prior Canon die-hard fan, I am so glad I took the plunge and tried a Panasonic; never looking back.",2,2,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,5
Priyanka,5,Best point and shoot I've ever owned,2013-10-31,N,"I've owned many film and digital point and shoot cameras over the years.  I've coveted the Lumix LX series for years and finally decided to take the plunge.  I'm so happy that I did!!<br /><br />I've always had issues with point and shoots since I generally shoot dSLRs or micro four thirds cameras.  Comparatively, the point and shoots have terrible image quality (which is pretty normal for a point and shoot), have frustrating shutter lag (like the Canon G9 I owned), or painfully low res LCD screens (like the Casio P&S's I've owned).  They can also have issues with being too bulky (like the Canon G series), or have a very slow lens that looks really soft when fully zoomed in.  In general, I'd rather pay 2x-4x the price of a good P&S to get a better camera.<br /><br />The LX7 is not perfect but it's far and away the best point and shoot I've ever owned.  The LCD is good enough to give you a reasonable idea of the quality of your photos, so if there is something wonky, you can correct it right away.  This was NOT the case with most of the early P&S digitals, and even some of the newer ones, like our Casio EX-FH100, which was otherwise a good camera but the LCD was so horrible you'd think you had taken horrible pictures because the screen didn't do them justice.  It's got pretty good response when pressing the release button and very little lag between shots.  So when I take snapshots of my toddler, my nieces and nephews, pets, or any rapidly moving subject, this camera does a very decent job of capturing the photo when you intend to.  It's not the smallest point and shoot, but it is far less bulky than most high end point and shoots.  The lens does not fully retract into the body, so it is a bit thick for a P&S.  But compared to the Canon G series (or similar) this is very reasonably sized.<br /><br />Image quality is about as good as I've seen on a camera of this size and price.  It takes VERY nice photos.  I've used P&S cameras that can't seem to decide where to focus, or they are unpredictable in how they will determine the correct exposure, so on those other cameras I'd have lots of underexposed or overexposed shots.  Not so with this camera.  It does a fantastic job with focus and exposure.<br /><br />The lens is bright and fast, which is FANTASTIC for taking snapshots indoors.  Makes it easy to get a good shot even if the light is less than ideal.  The only downside with the lens is that it only zooms to 3.4x, which makes it tough to photograph more distant subjects.  That said, unless you use this camera for specialized shooting, it's probably a reasonable tradeoff for most people.  The problem with reduced zoom is also mitigated by the high image quality.  Even if you can't zoom in that well, you can take the digital image and crop it significantly without too much loss in quality.  The lens also has a removable cap, which I think is not ideal, but otherwise not a real biggie for me.<br /><br />Overall I can highly recommend this camera.

Amazon Customer,4,Great image quality but software not compatible with Mac,2013-10-27,Y,"The camera is easy to use and is exceptional in capturing details in images. I am not a professional photographer, but I am a blogger and I frequently take pictures of food, nature and craft projects. I really appreciate the image quality that this camera provides and how it performs indoors and in low light. I have an older sony digital camera and I actually have preferred using the iPhone over the quality of my older camera, but this guy blows them both out of the water. Also, if you plan on taking pictures of moving subjects it does well. I took a great number of pictures of my pets to learn how to use the camera and a few of the images look like something you'd see in a magazine. Excellent quality with minimal effort.<br /><br />You do need to buy an additional memory card. Max capacity for images is something like 15-20 images.<br /><br />I gave this product 4 stars because included in the price are photo imaging software and raw data software which are NOT compatible with apple products even though the website states MAC compatible. It took me over an hour to get a hold of someone from Panasonic to inquire as to what I would need to do to obtain the software, but apparently in the fine print the &#34;MAC compatible&#34; only applies to the camera. The software is useless if you don't own windows and if you want something more the iPhoto you will have to purchase it at an additional cost.<br /><br />I am still learning about the camera and its many, many features and I'm nothing but impressed with the quality and ease of the camera.",0,0,Panasonic LUMIX DMC-LX7K 10.1 MP Digital Camera with 3.8x Optical zoom and 3.0-inch LCD -  Black,5

Mahesh,4,Awesome little camera,2013-10-19,Y,"A camera is only useful if you actually take pictures with it.  As much as I love my big Nikon, I often leave it home  because it's just too big and heavy.  This little camera is just what I need:  small and light, it's easy to carry everywhere, it takes great pictures and it has all the features you expect on a big SLR.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the aperture only closes down to f8 and I would have hoped that it would go down at least f16 or f22 on a camera of this quality. Otherwise, the f1.4 lens is awsome and when wide open it lets you soften backgrounds in ways that almost no other point and shoot camera can do. It also suffers from the lack of a cable release attachment but that at least can be fixed with a third party accessory.

Nilesh Katariya,5,Fantastic Camera... Best in Class,2013-09-26,N,"Was looking to replace my Leica D-Lux4, which I lost after using it for about 3 years.  I loved that Leica so I figured I'd replace it with the newest, improved model, the D-Lux6.  Having read all the comments over the years I thought I'd compare it to this Lumix.  I'm the type of person who would normally go for the \\""better\\"" model, but in this case it was a no brainer.  As I compared the 2 side by side I couldn't see how it made any sense to go for the Leica as the two cameras are virtually identical.  There may be some aspect that the Leica has internally.. I read all of the reviews that compare the two and still can't pinpoint what the difference actually is, if any. As a layman, if there is a differnce, it's not compelling enough to warrant spending double the price (about an extra $400) for it.  With the Leica you do get an external software program license included (Adobe Lightroom 5) which I wouldn't use anyway... I'm talking about the difference in the hardware.<br /><br />I've heard that the Leica and Lumix are made in the same factory.  Let's put it this way... they have to be made by the same company or one would be suing the other... just look at the two side by side... same exact camera.  They just use different fonts with their markings... and the Leica has a bit smoother feel when moving the knobs, which I prefer, but not a biggie and only noticed when comparing side by side to the Lumix.  So I went for the Lumix and have been very happy with it.<br /><br />I've had the Lumix for about 3 months... the photos are fantastic. Works very similar to my old Leica D4 but the photos are better... operates faster... small things you'd expect with a \\""new and improved\\"" model.  Assume that the Leica 6 would be also amazing (and better than my old 4)... just more expensive.<br /><br />Yes, I tollerate the same issue as I had with my Leica... having to remove the lens cap manually to shoot a photo... but I love the quality of the camera and the great photos so much that I put up with it.<br /><br />For the price, this camera is unbelievable.  In this class I feel there is no better choice.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDthat I put up with it.<br /><br />For the price, this camera is unbelievable.

AKHILESH KUMAR MAURYA,5,"Leica and Panasonic finally got it right, but buy the EVF too!",2013-09-25,Y,"The LX7 was an upgrade from my Leica D-Lux 4 (Lumix LX3). The LX7 is identical in function to the Leica D-Lux 6 in glass, sensor and overall function, has a nice built-in grip - the Leica does not, and there are only slight differences in menu user interface. The Leica will appeal to those who want to pay double or more for the name and little red dot, but there is no technical justification.  Same camera. So the rest of this review is about the Lumix LX-7.<br /><br />Lumix got this so exactly right, on a camera that has seen gentle evolutionary changes previously.<br /><br />First of all, don't be bamboozled by pixel count.  Although it is billed as 10MP, those are fat sensitive pixels on a large sensor area (1:1.7).  They also evolved from a CCD to a richer, more sensitive CMOS sensor, as many manufacturers have done over the years. The picture quality is superb, even in very low light, and up to about ISO 1600.  Shot at ISO 80-200, the resulting JPEGs are grainless up to 8x10 magnification, and will make a fine 16x20 uncropped. It seems folks are selling cameras with huge MP specs and teeny sensors these days; just so much marketing vaporware. This one makes no such nonsensical lie.<br /><br />I can this a Leica-Sonic, because, make no mistake, Leica did profoundly influence the lens design.  It's not that disingenuous to call it a Vario-Summilux; Summilux is Leica branding for their f1.4 lenses costing many thousands of dollars when made in Germany for the M-Series cameras, and this is a true f1.4 lens at 24mm equivalent. At the 90mm equivalent end of the range, it's still f2.3.  Couple that with excellent anti-shake, and you have a discrete digicam for wideangle, normal and macro use which can shoot hand-held in near zero light at a half-second. It is not for telephoto-lovers, the 20x zoom cameras have more reach but nowhere near this image quality. But at the 24mm end, very little barrel distortion, sharp out to the corners, and you can focus in macro mode objects which nearly touch the lens!<br /><br />Some unique features which no one else offers:<br /><br />(1) The f1.4 lens.  Are you kidding me?  They are not.  Go find it anywhere else, except on your fixed focal length prime lens for the DSLR. It not only allows extreme low light shooting, but even lets you create shallow depth-of field for close portraits, which no other digicams can.  And if you want to do this in bright light, where the 1/4000 sec fastest shutter and ISO 80 would otherwise not allow you to use the f1.4 max aperture, it even has a built-in neutral density filter with a dedicated button, so you can still shoot wide open. Extraordinary lens.  Okay, so maybe Ernst Leitz would turn over in the casket if he ever saw the Summilux name applied to a Japanese-manufactured lens on a pocket camera, but it's a fantastic lens.<br /><br />(2) The variable aspect ratio switch - you can shoot 3:2 like traditional 35mm, 4:3 like an iPad, 16:9 if you know you are going to view on a widescreen monitor or TV, and - new for this version - even 1:1.  All those crops come out of an oversized 12MP circular image sensor, so you can crop before you shoot, not after, and maintain far more image detail. At the flip of a switch just above the lens.<br /><br />(3) The manual controls are extensive and well placed.  You can certainly shoot in iA (intelligent auto) and be hard-pressed to screw up anything, or control everything. But for manual shooters, at least use P, so that you can override white balance, focus or aperture when needed. And the manual focus mode and metering mode controls are excellent. Any time you use A or M, or override the P setting with a well-placed multi-control dial, you see the resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings instantly.<br /><br />(4) It has an aperture ring!! - While most digicams have only an f4-f8 aperture range, making manual control of aperture and shutter almost useless, this f1.4 lens has a manual aperture ring from f1.4 to f8 right on the lens barrel, so you can shoot in A mode like it was a traditional SLR. Even most modern DSLR lenses don't have one anymore.  That is a priceless feature for aperture priority shooters.<br /><br />(5) Exposure compensation.  Any serious pro camera has a bias dial, the +/- exposure control that lets you bias the auto exposure up or down in 1-stop or partial stop increments.  Go find it on an iPhone, nope.  Go find it on most prosumer digicams; it is often buried in menus.  But on the Lumix LX7, the multi-control ring lets you change it instantly, while the display shows you the plus/minus bias and and resulting aperture/shutter speed pairings, either on screen or in the viewfinder.<br /><br />No camera's meter is smart enough to correctly expose every shot without exposure bias. I use this feature with nearly every picture I take, on every camera I use.  I even use it on my Pantech Discover cell phone (sorry, Apple). But on the Lumix, it is utterly convenient and professional, an indispensable tool.<br /><br />(6) The mode dial was stiffened up over earlier versions; it will no longer move by itself in the pocket or case. And when you change it, a spinning dial on the display easily shows you the set mode (iA, A, P, M, etc) in BIG letters, so you know the mode set without removing eyes from the screen or finder.<br /><br />(7) Did I say \\""finder\\""?  I am a 56-year old eyeglass wearer who grew up on pro Nikons with great optical viewfinders.  While I loved my previous Leica-Sonic (the f2 lensed LX3 / D-Lux 4) for image quality and portability, I could not use it at arms length without the eyeglasses on and off like a yo-yo.  So candid and action shots were nearly impossible, just like most arm's length digicams.  So I never replaced my Nikon's normal lens or considered the Leica D-Lux 4 a true alternative. And after shooting, in bright light you couldn't see or edit what you shot, unless you hid inside someplace dark (same problem with DSLRs).<br /><br />Enter the new Leica-Sonic (Lumix LX7) with the LVF2 viewfinder. The finder, made by Olympus but marketed for Leica (EVF) and Lumix (LVF), slides into the shoe, and transforms this little digicam into a near DSLR, in some ways better. It's bright, contrasty, shows you the accurate framing, focus and exposure and all settings - everything you can see on the 3\\"" rear LCD.  Or not.  Flip back and forth between finder and screen with a button. Switch on and off the extra finder info with a button. Then review your just-shot picture in the finder as well. Not even my Nikons let me do this, so when you simply must verify exposure, focus or anything else outdoors, the EVF is transformative for photography. Yes, it does create some bulk, but as a tool, it is the single biggest advance in small cameras since we did away with film. Buying this accessory is essential, even if you have to carry it in a separate pocket.<br /><br />(8) Framing. My Nikons and previous Leica-Sonic had an electronic grid you could overlay on the screen when you needed to line up composition, like the lines on a large-format camera's ground glass.  It was too busy and distracting on a small screen. So this time around, Lumix replaced it with a live 'gyro', a horizon line and vertical line which move to help you keep the camera level while shooting, without getting in the way.  As with all the other display features, it is easily turned off and on with a button.<br /><br />(9) Frame Rate. I thought I had died and gone upstairs when I learned how to trick my Nikon D300 into shooting nine frames per second (fps) instead of the advertised six. It has allowed me to capture instants in time otherwise impossible. Anyone not trying out this feature is missing out on capturing something really spectacular; I've taught several students to capture sports action like pros by using high frame rate. Well, this Lumix LX7 shoots ELEVEN fps. Sorry Nikon, but the little mirror-less camera has you beat here. And with a class 10 SDcard installed, it will keep up, even at full resolution.  Wow.<br /><br />Nitpick 1:  I've read many reviews panning this camera because it does not have a retractable lens cover. Rather, it has a traditional cap which you manually remove and replace, just like on a real camera, and it attaches with a small string tether to the strap lug so you don't lose it while shooting.  My response is \\""Bee-Eff-Dee\\"". I have to uncap my Nikons to shoot them, and since their lenses interchange, the cap goes in my case or pocket while shooting.  With the Lumix, at least you always know where the cap is.  Let's face it; this is not a toy, it is a serious photographer's small camera (I will not call it a point-and-shoot, out of respect).  So if you want a retractable lens cover, go get a toy camera.  Else, deal with it.<br /><br />Nitpick2: Panasonic markets this as having a 7.5x Intelligent Zoom.  Please do not insult MY intelligence. This is a 3.8x OPTICAL zoom lens, a 24-90mm equivalent in 35mm film parlance. The fact that you can crop in from that by 'zooming' past the optical limits has little practical value.  By now, most digicam buyers get that, so Panasonic is attempting to rebrand digital zoom as something more than digital in-camera crop. But it is not a 7.5x lens, and the product title should not feature than number.  It cheapens an otherwise excellent product aimed at the prosumer market, not the K-Market.<br /><br />Nitpick3: Ken Rockwell, who has authored many fine camera reviews, has routinely panned this Leica / Lumix camera series. In his words, \\""it's not a real Leica\\"".  Well, no kidding, Ken. It also does not cost ten thousands bucks, body alone, plus lenses at several thousand per.  But for most ordinary humans wanting professional image quality and features without a mortgage, it is all the Leica we will ever need.  And for me, I can ski with it at 50mph in my pocket, ride my bike with it in my saddle bag, and always have it handy.  I don't know anyone who would treat a Leica M9 this way.  Most of them sit locked behind glass display cabinets.  Mine makes photos.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I still keep my Nikon's 50mm f1.4 lens for fine portraiture and product photography, and to keep at least one mid-range lens for the D300. But I recently sold my Nikon's ten-year-old massive 28-70mm f2.8 pro lens, for $900, once I bought the Lumix). Why?  Because the LX7 obsoleted the Nikkor. The LX7 cost me far less in total with viewfinder, spare battery, cards, EVF, leather half-case and leather wrist strap than I sold the well-used Nikkor lens for. And because it is far more versatile and pocketable, it takes more and better pictures.<br /><br />All I use the Nikon D300 now for is for ultrawide (the 16mm fisheye and 12-24mm lenses) and telephoto (the 70-210mm f2.8) shooting. For everything else, the LX7 with the EVF is now this professional photographer's primary camera.<br /><br />Just don't call it a point-and-shoot. You will insult it.<br /><br />Bob Reed / Alpine Imagesnew Leica-Sonic (Lumix LX7) with the LVF2 viewfinder.

Rajesh Dalei,5,"Outstanding quality,  fairly priced!",2013-09-25,Y,"I have owned mine for a couple of months and I'm surprised at how much I really like this camera.  Used to larger format DSLRS and medium format film cameras,  I am amazed at the quality of the LX7's images. I have a series of 12X18 prints that I've framed that are outstanding. I believe that 16X20's would have been possible.  Its imaging quality far exceeds what most people will be asking of it.<br /><br />Just a few of the pros:<br /><br />-Very fast 1.4 lens with wide 24mm (35mm equivalent) lens.  Leica sharp!  Modest  but usable zoom range for inside applications. Very good noise control.  Shoot at 800 ISO without worry.  1600 if you really need it.  In most home situations with fast lens &  800 speed no need for flash.<br />-Very good JEPG's right out of the box.  But plenty of features to allow DSLR type of control. RAW available.<br />-Useful zoom features that allow you to program stops a various focal lengths and a return to last used zoom position when turning on the camera.<br />- Special effects filters that are actually useful. Aspect control and f-stop control on the lens barrel.<br /><br />This camera is  small, palmable, but not really a pocket camera.  It does does not have the megapixel rating of some of the new cameras, but it is an excellent balance of image quality given the size of the sensor.  Too many megapixels on a small sensor can lead to noise issues.  Panasonic understands this and couples a sharp lens, reasonable number of megapixels, and good image processing software to produce a camera that is first rate. I suspect  that with the competition touting more megapixels and larger sensors that this little camera may not be around for too much longer.  At its current price and given its quality of construction and image quality, it's a steal!<br /><br />There is only one thing that really offers an improvement to the existing package and that is a separate optical viewfinder.  Panasonic  offers one but I chose the Olympus VF-1.  An optical veiwfinder fits in the flash shoe on top and provides a wonderfully bright and useful way for you to frame your images, especially out of doors.  See my review of the Olympus VF-1 for a more detailed discussion of this.<br /><br />All of the glowing reviews are not hype, this is an excellent camera!  I'd buy again.veiwfinder fits in the flash shoe on top and provides a wonderfully bright and useful way for you to frame your images, especially out of doors.

Saleem,5,Simple but sophisticated.,2013-09-22,Y,"This is a very easy-to-use camera -- lightweight, compact and every control function logically laid out.  The iA and P (program) features work as expected, and the manual settings are as sophisticated as most DSLR cameras.  Anti-shake works very well, making the use of a tripod unnecessary for almost all shootings.  The camera is extremely fast for it's type, and the battery life is more than acceptable.  Best of all, the picture quality compares well to most DSLR.  It would be a significant improvement if there's a built-in view finder, GPS bookmark and wifi capability.

Amazon Customer,1,Faulty product,2013-09-20,Y,Received the LX7 from Nesro's Electronics via Amazon. The camera worked fine in the beginning but now the zoom in/out lever doesn't work well. You can either stay wide angle or zoom all the way to telephoto end. But Amazon doesn't allow returns so I am stuck. This was already the 2nd faulty camera experience with Amazon and LX7.

M.Suresh,5,I love this little camera! Get the viewfinder for best results.,2013-09-18,N,"Yes, we have all seen the reviews of the Sony RX100 2 being the best compact camera. It is also one of the most expensive compact cameras. I didn't want to spend $ 1 2 0 0  to get the RX1002 (with viewfinder) so I looked at other options. Boy, am I glad I did. I found this little gem. I have had it for two weeks and so far, I am very impressed with it.<br /><br />Some features that are outstanding...<br /><br />24mm wide (better than most kit lenses cameras come with)Better than the RX100 and RX1002<br />1.4-2.3 Leica lens (2.3 at the long end of the zoom! Unheard of in most cameras)<br />Built in ND 3 stop filter so you can use F1.4 in bright light. Need an ND filter?  Just press the ND filter button.<br />Level<br />Great video with full manual control if you need it<br />Reasonably priced viewfinder (compared to Sony's ridiculously priced viewfinder for the RX1002)<br />HDR in camera<br />Intelligent auto takes great pics if you want to use it as a point and shoot<br />Aperture ring<br />Change aspect ratio on the fly without searching through menus<br />Has the right amount of megapixels to match the sensor. Thank you Panasonic for not playing the more-megapixels-is-better marketing game.<br />1cm macro-WOW! If you use macro and focus close to your subject you get a beautiful blurry background and it makes your subject pop off of the screen/paper.<br />Quiet shutter for discrete shooting-Turn off the beeps and you can take shots in quiet sections of concerts or churches.<br />120 frames per second slow motion video (abeit only 720p and no sound)<br /><br />Don't buy into the the marketing hype that you have to have a larger sensor to get great image quality. This camera gets stunning results at lower iso settings. Since it has a 1.4 aperture, you rarely have to use higher iso settings.<br /><br />I could go on and on but there are already a lot of in depth reviews.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this is a serious little compact camera capable of taking some amazing photos and videos. It inspires me to go out and shoot. It is light, you barely feel it around your neck. You go completely unnoticed when you are shooting on the street. No one gives the camera a second look because it doesn't have a giant white lens sticking out of it. It focuses fast so it makes an excellent street camera. Also, for more discrete situations, you can turn off the sound and back screen and take candid pics.<br /><br />It is so nice to have a little camera with a really fast 24mm lens, decent zoom, and incredible macro without having to carry a macro lens. I may end up using this more than my Sony Nex7. We'll see.<br /><br />There are some things it is missing.<br /><br />GPS<br />A moveable back screen<br />Wifi<br />NF communication<br />Focus peaking (This is one feature that Sony has that I would love to se on this camera) I use this feature on my Nex7 camera all the time.<br /><br />If you can live without these features, get this camera today.

I think the leak happened at the button to press to take photos. I was never impressed by the photo quality.  The colors seemed off and the photos seemed noisy.  The good things about this camera are that it is small and easy to carry and less expensive than some of the competing cameras.  It is fine for the beach.

Beware of water drops on lens while shooting in water.,2015-06-21,N,"I received this camera as a replacement for a DMC-TS20 that failed after first use in water, a couple hours in pool and ocean (beach, max 2 feet deep) and the screen started cutting out and fading. I took several complaints and the intervention of the BBB New Jersey to get Panasonic to replace it since I did not buy this one on Amazon unlike most other items. The DMC-TS25 I received as a replacement did survive our recent Mexico trip including several times in ocean and an entire day at Xel-ha water park.  UPDATE (August 2016): I took the camera on another trip to Mexico and after a few days in the pool and ocean the replacement camera failed as well. I noticed some moisture in the battery compartment and two of the battery contacts have some corrosion. I know for sure that the door lock was always engaged. Very disappointed since this is now the second vacation that was 'ruined' by a Panasonic camera. I only had an iPhone 6s which I could not take into the water or the park with it underground rivers and caves. That left me only with a GoPro Hero which took good video but is not really suitable for pictures. This was the last Panasonic camera I will ever buy.

sravanth,4,Great pictures and bad seal,2015-06-07,Y,"It takes great pictures in and out of water. My only complaint is that it is very difficult to keep tiny grains of sand or dust out of the seal, and this camera is very sensitive to any little thing in the seal. I have used it snorkeling in the bay and to get pictures on land. It works great for both, but the seal is difficult to keep clean. I had an Olympus camera before I bought this one, and the Olympus was much easier to keep clean. The Olympus would not work if there was sand or dust in the seal, but I did not have a problem with either getting into the seal. It was also relatively easy to clean the seal area. It is pretty difficult to get sand out of the seal on this little camera. I need a needle and a magnifying glass to do it, because ANYTHING in the seal will mess up the camera.

Atteli anusha,1,CAMERA WATERLOGGED DURING FIRST UNDERWATER USE!!  POOR RETURN POLICY/PANASONICS REPAIR WEBSITE NON-EXISTANT,2015-03-23,Y,"I normally don't write reviews, but am so infuriated with this product!  (Definitely NOT WATERPROOF!!) Used once (above water) while on vacation in the tropics, didn't get wet or submerge or open the battery / SD compartment in the water or even after out of the water- took nice pictures. The next day, this time shallow water snorkeling, followed all precautions and double checked everything before getting in water (camera was attached to my wrist via Float strap), as soon as camera went below surface, noticed the flash-flashing frequently and spontaneously, then the display screen started to cut in and out- then nothing.  I brought the camera above water, turned it off, then turned on again-the flash still firing spontaneously and nothing on the display screen. Took the camera to my hotel room, followed the post-salt water exposure procedures and after camera was dry -opened the battery/SD compartment- pretty dry, only a few water streaks when I removed the battery and top of SD card was damp- however lens and flash completely fogged and water with bubbles trapped in camera behind the display screen.  Checked the camera's casing for cracks, pinholes, checked seams- everything looked normal.  I bought this camera on Jan 27th,2015 and used as above March 9th and 10th. Can't return to  Amazon (they will only allow return for this device for 30 days-What a load of crap!!).  Tried to request repair thru www.panasonic.com/repair- this website doesn't exist and redirects you to shop.panasonic website!!  (I did complete warranty registration thru Panasonic, also received info on Square Trade Warranty Extension-  but, when try to extend warranty- Square Trade say's &#34;sorry purchase price is too low to cover this product&#34;.)

Mind you, it's not going to perform as well as many more expensive cameras, but for a lot of uses, it is plenty good enough. Our purchase was initiated because we were headed for a day of snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef (though we are using it as a pocket sized utility point-and-shooter for other purposes as well.) It stayed submerged for several hours (longer than the manufacturers recommendation) without any leaks or problems. As always, we were very careful to keep dirt particles and hair out of the seals. A lot of cameras have died because people don't pay attention to this...    It's not going to replace any of our more expensive cameras, but it will be a useful adjunct in the years to come.",1,1,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 16.1 MP Tough Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom,1
Krishnaa,5,A great camera at a great value.,2015-01-19,Y,"Great value for the money!<br />When I read reviews on this product, I was a bit nervous about taking the camera into salt-water situations.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to see this camera hold up to varying conditions without leaking.  This camera easily survived the Great Barrier Reef (warm salt water) and the bays of New Zealand (COLD salt water conditions) without incident.  Photo quality is very good--- but I would warn users to experiment with the settings to find a setting that works for you.  For example, I used easy auto, but I felt that the underwater setting (which was originally recommended for deeper scenarios) actually produced more natural color images.<br />It is VERY important that users follow the directions for maintenance in order to avoid leakage.  For example, you should always soak the camera in fresh water after taking it into salt water!  Also, it is critical to check the seals for any contaminants before dunking it into any water!  If you're careful, this product will definitely do the job.<br />All in all, it's a great camera that won't break the bank.",2,2,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 16.1 MP Tough Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom,4

KIRAN PATEL,1,Don't be fooled by the average review,2015-01-11,N,"EDIT 5/16/15: This camera just gets worse. Stills suck. Video is horrible. All of it worse than my 3-year old Lumia phone camera. That is seriously bad. Tried shooting panoramas with it during a long trail run today up several mountains. It pretty much ruined them all. They're striped like zebras, because the camera is too stupid to fix the exposure and/or the stitching algorithm is too dumb to compensate for vignetting that sometimes comes at the end of individual frames.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in this camera. I am a normally user of higher-end gear (Fuji finepix x100, Canon EOS full frame SLRs, etc.) I believe my expectations were right on this camera. I just wanted a small, pocketable camera that could handle being out in the rain on trail runs, and produce *decent* pictures. By decent, I mean better than my cell phone (Lumia 920). I did not expect something as good as, say, a Fuji x20 or anything like that.<br /><br />This camera performs worse than my cell phone and worse than several much older Canon powershots.<br /><br />I have tested the images from this camera against those produced by my Lumia 920 and they are inferior in every way. I can hardly believe it. Despite being made with what should be a higher-quality lens and with a much higher pixel count, detail is lacking. They're both noisier and over-smoothed. The photos are mushy, indistinct, and incredibly, the phone does a much better job auto-balancing the light source. That's a 3 year-old phone, with a smaller, less pixel-dense chip, outperforming a much newer camera. That's a camera, with a dedicated photo logic chip underperforming a phone's camera app.<br /><br />Bad.<br /><br />I cannot speak to its water, weather, or shock proofness, and I don't know if I'll ever be able too. When it takes photos worse than the phone, why would I ever carry it, except maybe into the pool or into the certain death of the beach? That may be all it's good for, but just expect low image quality.",13,12,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 16.1 MP Tough Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom,3

Mayuri,4,I really like this camera,2015-01-07,Y,"I really like this camera.  I would actually give it 4.5 stars, but that wasn't an option, so I went with 4.  I bought it mainly for underwater purposes, as I already have a Panasonic Lumix for above-water (5 stars for that one!).  That being said, I loved the Advanced Underwater mode.  The colors were true, and not greened out.  Beach mode though (which the manual says to use for up to 10 ft underwater) was not as impressive when underwater.  I found it to be your average green-washed underwater photos, even when I was taking the pics less than 10 ft under.  Pictures taken above water using Beach mode were very satisfactory!  They were sharp, and good color tone.<br /><br />I did find the focusing to be a little lacking when using my zoom at maximum capacity for distant objects.  The picture didn't turn out as sharp as it should have been, very faint soft edges.<br /><br />One last comment, and I think this probably has more to do with my untrained underwater-picture-taking skills than the camera itself.  I found it very difficult to take in-focus pictures underwater.  Yes, I was moving, but only in the sense that I was kicking to keep myself in place.  Of course, the fish were moving as well, so I'm sure that doubly complicates things.  Note that I haven't checked to see if the camera has a shake stabilizer or not, which probably becomes irrelevant when capturing erratic-moving animals.  I probably had a 60-65% totally in focus percentage.<br /><br />So all-in-all, despite my critiques, I found it to be very good considering the affordable price.  I can take pictures underwater with true color, the zoom is adequate enough to allow marine close-ups, and the camera is passable as a point-and-shoot on land.<br /><br />Oh, love the size and weight as well.  Small and light!

The image quality is just not up to par even for this low price.  It tends to overexpose also.  Sometimes you can get a decent looking image. And if you are just looking for fun shots for the web or small prints (3x5, 4x6) you'll be OK. But if you are used to a better level of IQ you will be disappointed.<br /><br />The camera is small and very pocketable and if the IQ were just a little better, it would be fine.

Just brought the new camera on vacation....yup, this new one gets water/fog in it as well.  You can put it under water and see bubbles coming out from the mic area so there is a definite fault in the design.<br />You also make sacrifices when it comes to picture quality with these cameras that are designed for underwater use.

Frostshadow,4,Great camera for the price.,2014-12-08,Y,"Overall we really enjoy this camera.  We haven't done a lot of underwater use, but we have taken it down waterslides, etc. and have not had any issues with it leaking.  We love that we don't have to worry about water (especially places like Disneyland...went right down Splash Mountain with us).<br /><br />The pictures are mostly good.  You do get a dark, fuzzy, etc. picture occasionally on the auto setting.  Outdoor pictures are by far the best.  We do change the settings if we have time, but often it is a picture of kids doing things &#34;right now&#34; and changing the setting would cause us to miss the shot.  I love that it is digital and you can see the results right away.  I haven't printed any large pictures yet, but the regular size looks great.  The movie feature is wonderful and we love recording digital videos.  They save in the correct format for Windows 8, which won't play any of our old videos.",0,0,Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS25 16.1 MP Tough Digital Camera with 8x Intelligent Zoom,4

There was no sign of any problem other than possibly excessive battery drain. When I opened the battery compartment, I found a few drops of water on the battery near the terminal end. After drying out the battery compartment (it was visibly free of water and debris), I installed a fresh battery and took the camera on a second snorkel. It failed in about thirty minutes. The programming functions appeared to be accessible, but the display was locked in extreme over-exposure, making it impossible to use the camera. Panasonic says the compartment seal should be replaced every year or so, but a buyer has no way of knowing how long a camera sat on a shelf before purchase.

Wish I had.,2015-08-19,Y,"I never write reviews, but I feel that I should put this out there for any parents to be that are considering this camera....I wish I had known some of this before purchasing.  The good: When it works, it is a good camera. The fact you (or relatives if you choose to share access credentials) can access it via the phone app is great. The picture is clear, can record and set alerts for movement, etc. The night vision on it is good quality and the color picture is outstanding.  The bad: As of late we have been having ALOT of issues with this camera. It is resetting itself and disconnecting from the wifi. I feel it's also important to mention that there are Samsung server maintenance from time to time. These happen in the middle of the night. If you are using this camera to monitor your baby, chances are you'll be needing to use it in the middle of the night. I know I'm not the only parent having this issue, as several mothers in a group I belong too are having similar issues (and it's a geographically diverse group, so not a Internet Service Provider issue)  Bottom line, while it is a nice camera, I find it to be unreliable.

Ramesh,2,"Hardware works great, software is a bust",2015-08-18,Y,"I was really looking forward adding this little camera to my existing Sharx ruled security camera assortment. My criteria were 1080p, motion trigger, email notifications, infrared and remote monitoring. On paper it appears this camera has it all including a good price.  The hardware is working great. Excellent image quality during the day and night but the challenges came with the software. Yes, I was able to setup the UPNP port forwarding on my router but Samsung does not clearly describe this process as detailed as they should. I was able to remotely monitor the camera on my iPhone from work using a universal IP camera viewer app that I also used for all my other security cameras. So far so good.  I was not able to get the email notification system to work. For some reason the on-board camera software (over http) did not accept the gmail server settings, port and user/password combo even though the same settings worked fine with all my Sharx cameras. So I tried the setup over the Sammy website where you first need to register and then you can setup notifications based on motion or sounds. You can check a 'google' checkbox and request notifications by google email and picasa web albums but neither of these features are working for me. Samsung posted a note that picasa webalbums are no longer supported and the website still did not accept my google login settings even though I followed all instructions and setup my google account to accept the new device.  At some point I just gave up trying to get things to work, initiated the return process and will go back to the more expensive but reliable Sharx security camera systems which do not have a slick looking OS or control software, but they just work all the time when they need to and allow full configuration without the use for any external software.  Your mileage may vary and you may not need some of the features that I was looking forward to and in that case the unit would be just fine. I really  like the form factor, looks and the image quality was excellent but the software needs more work.",2,2,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,1
Amazon Customer,3,- It has a good feature set on paper,2015-08-17,Y,"Pros:<br />- It can record to sd card.<br />- It has a good feature set on paper.<br />- The picture is very clear.<br />- It's got a nice wide field of view.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The web interface is miserable. It requires custom browser plugins (and on at least some platforms tries to install a chrome plugin that uses the no-longer-supported NPAPI. HTML 5 please!). It's somewhat buggy and the UX is terrible. To give one specific example, there doesn't seem to be a good way to skim through lots of video looking for something specific. You've got to either watch the whole thing (in my case hours and hours of video), or jump in small increments and restart play each time, which takes a few seconds for each skip.<br />- There isn't an obvious way to use it without going through samsung's site/systems. I want to forward a port on my router and connect directly to it.

So I'm convinced this is NOT bandwidth friendly, and it needlessly streams the video through the internet even when you're locally connected. terrible product.",1,0,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4
Amazon Customer,1,This product is horrible,2015-07-31,N,"I can't fathom how anyone would rate this product more than one star.  You have to go through a trial and error process to set it up.  I got it running finally on Wifi and could never get it to 'hold' it's connection to the network without needing to reboot the camera (which is impossible to do when you are not at the location). I finally just moved it to a location where I could connect it with the Ethernet cable directly to the router.  Now it's been holding a good connection to the network without rebooting the camera, but it constantly loses it's connection to the network when viewing via my iPhone 6.  You will find yourself constantly re-logging it and getting dropped connections.  The software user interface is also horrible.  I'd like to try a Nest to replace it, but those damn things cost $200 a pop too.  Then the one great feature they had which was to send motion detection image to Picassa 'went away'...I'm guessing because Google shut them down because of the bandwidth or disk space being used up.  That was a great feature that all of a sudden wasn't there one day, so you are screwed with the only alternative being to use an SD card to capture images.",2,0,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4

Alok N.,4,"Overall pleased, some caveats",2015-07-29,Y,"A few months now since I hooked this up so I have a decent amount of real life use to review on now. For the quick reader, I'm actually leaving the review now because I looked the purchase back up to see present day price, as I'm interested in buying another now. That should give you my quick take...<br /><br />The much much longer version:<br />Out of the box I tried setting this thing up via the Samsung Smartcam website option on my computer, as I wanted to eventually access the thing online through the site from my work computer anyway, figured I'd set it up all at once. I can't say exactly what the issue was, I was able to create an account, but just not able to find the camera when I hit it's Wifi direct button. Network was fine I confirmed. Either way I gave up and switched gears to following the smart phone quick set up guide with my Samsung phone. Followed instructions to down load their app from from Google Play and logged in real quick as I already set it up online, hit the Wifi direct it all went real quick and easy on the first try. Setting the app up on my wife's phone and logging her in to the same account was also simple. We both have no issues using the app on the same account. Full disclosure, both are Samsung phones.<br /><br />Caveat: 1 of the 4 huge draws for this thing while researching was it said once motion was detected it would send me pics to my google account/ email. Having trouble setting that up however, I found out the only way it would work was if I let down some privacy/security setting in my Google account to allow other 3rd party programs or apps etc. access or control my account. In this day in age, doing so much with my phone and the Android OS being so tied in to our Google accounts, I just didn't like the major warnings my Google account was throwing up at me while trying follow the security let down steps, so I chickened out and scratched the idea altogether. If someone is compelled to contradict, provide clarity, or guide me towards a way to do it without relaxing the security, by all means. Otherwise, deduct 1 star for not working, and 1 more for not at least fine-printing that to me us front...<br /><br />Picture quality was another draw and this doesn't disappoint. Full disclosure again, when I open the app it always defaults to low quality mode but while I have no data issues, I appreciate it as an attempt to preserve data if only to stick it back the over priced providers/carriers :) Anyway if I choose to push HQ mode which is right on the screen, quality bumps right up and looks great.<br /><br />Third draw, wide field of view. I have one set up high by the ceiling and the wide field of view spans our entire open floor plan. Full disclosure again, its the fish eye view look, but works for me.<br /><br />Last draw was the motion detection, which also works great. It lets you set the motion sensitivity which I though was curious; perhaps some have reasons they would allow a little motion go by but not a lot? a pet snake? a ghost? I couldn't think of any in my house so I just jacked it up all the way (you can also set it to act on sound detection, I tested it, but have no real life use to speak on). You can set the app to alert you when motion is detected, full disclosure moment: the app must be open on your phone to do so, something I'm not crazy about and another reason the Gmail alerts fail stinks. You can set it to record locally to the SD card all the time, but also just when motion is detected as well, which I use. You can also record the video and/or image to your phone in the app too, in case you actually catch someone enter your house BEFORE they knock out the camera and take the SD card as other reviewers have mentioned renders the camera useless to them, maybe grab a shot of someone's face... I'm trying here... but I haven't really used the app recording beyond a test either.  For my purposes the alerts from the app and sd card recording serve me very well, specific examplebeing the couple of weeks we had a crew working in the basement while we were out at work. I trusted our main contractor guy but I didn't know his crew from the holes in the walls they were making down there. The camera was set up upstairs and had the basement and bathroom doors in its wide field of view. I would get an alert that there was motion on my cell while at work (again with app open), and when I accessed the sd card recording from my phone it came right up and streamed great on 4G. The video recordings are listed by date and labeled by exact start to end time to the seconds. I use the list of recorded events by date like this. Another option is dates in something like a pie graph, which again is just curious to me, maybe someone has a use... Anyway I did this for two weeks and every time I got an alert I'd look at the latest recording and it would pick up ~5 secs before any motion would come into the room, which I think is great, and then I'd see the basement door open and a worker come out and go into the bathroom door, and usually come back out a minute later.  Yes for some of the longer bathroom breaks yes it took a second recording to catch the guy coming out, but you can change the duration of recordings. The camera was in their field of view too, so it provided peace of mind to me as a deterrent as well. It defaults out of the box to show a little green LED on front when in use but there's an option in the app to shut this off too, I guess depending on whether you're the subject and want to know if you're being viewed, or you're the viewer and don't want your subjects to know they are. I toggle.<br /><br />Night vision is clear, and all works when in NV mode as well.<br /><br />Last bit is a caveat regarding the blue R. I got it on and off for about a week. I would get this blue R on the screen when I accessed the camera from my phone when away form the house/network, and it wouldn't let me see HQ mode, or access my recordings. I had to internet search what this was as the app tells you nothing about it and I found out through internet searching that buried somewhere on the support section of SamsungSmartcam site it says this is &#34;Relay&#34; mode, engaged when the wifi network the camera is on loses a strong enough signal to handle its higher bandwidth functions. When this happens it relays a low quality version of your signal to Samsung's servers or something, which relay it to you, as a means to still get you anything. I rebooted my router and all was great again, which tells me it was my router. I saw a &#34;helpful' ranked review complaining about this but as for me I'm actually adding a start back for this feature. Not only does it find a work around and still get me some signal when my network becomes unstable (they could've just chosen to let it drop off when the bandwidth falls below full function minimum requirements, and kick a message like &#34;no signal detected as many other remote cameras do&#34;), but to me it served as a means of letting me know my router needed the reboot. That's an added unexpected feature to me.",2,2,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,2

Amazon Customer,3,Beautiful video but that's about it,2015-07-26,Y,"The video quality on this camera is absolutely clear. It looks as if you're in the room. However, even when the room is absolutely quiet, there is this buzzing noise that comes out of the camera. I couldn't get rid of it even after I reset it a couple of times. In addition, I was hoping to be able to create multiple accounts so that I wouldn't be the only one with access to it. That's not the case. If I want someone else to be able to see it, like my mom who is overseas, I would have to give her my log in information for my account, and still it wouldn't work because her phone would have to be near the camera for the initial set up. It's good that the camera comes with a slot for a memory card, for local video recording in the event that it detected motion or sound but that's not enough to for me too keep the camera. Also, you can't remotely move the camera to look around the room.

Amazon Customer,1,Doesn't work as advertised; poor customer service; complete lack of attention by Samsung,2015-07-11,Y,"I purchased this camera just over a year ago. The reason I chose this it, was because it had the ability to take a photo when there was motion detected and then send it to my Gmail as an e-mail.  The camera was relatively easy to set up and though it experiences frequent loss of connectivity; the camera did what I needed it to do. (the loss of connectivity is an ongoing problem)  s  I received an e-mail with a photo each time there was motion within the set parameters.  Then, in February of 2015, 8 months after purchase; the e-mail of photos stopped.  I left the house at 6pm and there was a photo sent to my e-mail of me pulling out of my parking spot. Then, an hour later, I came home and did not get an e-mail.  As of this writing (July 11, 2015), I have received only 4 e-mails with photos.  Those happened out of the blue in May.  When it first stopped working, I called customer service.  The first person I spoke with was very put off my my phone call and told me that there were problems with the servers and that I would just have to wait.  When I asked what Samsung was doing for it's customers who had a device that no longer functioned as advertised:  he hung up.  I called again and got a lovely gentlemen who had not heard of any software or server problems and stepped me through all the settings making sure everything was right.  It was.  He asked me to do a hard reset saying that should solve the problem.  He said to call back if this didn't work.  After hanging up, I did this -  and it did not solve the problem.  I called a third time; speaking to a third person; who was very grumpy; and he told me that he had just found out &#34;last night&#34; that there was a software problem.  It seems very odd to me that the customer service people are not all informed when there is a widespread problem with a device.  Also, they are are in desperate need of basic customer service training.  I see on other comments here that I am not alone in losing the advertised functionality of the camera.  I also attempted to contact someone in writing as per the instructions on the website.  I did not receive a response.  Nor, was there any information on the website about this apparently widespread problem with this device.<br /><br />If you want a camera that you can check in with and see live images or hear what is going on; then this is fine.  But, when I purchased this camera, it advertised the taking of photos and e-mail, which no longer works.  Also, poor customer service and a lack of &#34;standing behind the product&#34; would suggest the necessity to look elsewhere.",6,4,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,3

Zubin Ray,2,Google/Picasa image upload support has been broken for months,2015-07-10,N,"One of the cool features of this camera is it's ability to upload images to the internet.  It supports upload to Picasa.  At some point it also supported uploads to Youtube, but that feature is no longer available.<br /><br />On April 20th 2012, the API that this camera uses to login to Google accounts was deprecated by Google.  That means no one should have been using it anymore, because the API would be removed in the future.  In 2015, this deprecated API was completely disabled by Google and the camera stopped working with Google.  So it can no longer upload images.  I was thinking of buying another camera but I won't until this issue is fixed by Samsung.  If it isn't fixed then I will be a very disappointed customer.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the camera may be 1080p, but it doesn't let you access video at 1080p from an external device.  You can take the SD card out and access the video as recorded, but that is probably not how most people are going to be looking at the video.  If you need to preserve something from the camera at it's original resolution (which is kind of the point of having a camera like this), you need to turn it off and physically remove the memory card (assuming you had recording to the memory card enabled).<br /><br />It would be a lot nicer if the web based UI for the camera allowed video downloads.",3,3,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,1

Do NOT get this camera.  If you're still reading my review, here's a bit more detail.  I run their SmartCam app on a spare iPad in my office so I can see who's at the front door. When it works, it works well. But the problem is that I lose the connection several times each day. There's no rhyme or reason. Sometimes the app is connected and giving me a feed for hours straight. Other times, I lose the connection, reconnect, and lose the connection within seconds of opening the app. It's unreliable, and that makes this an unreliable security camera. I have tested this on multiple iOS devices. And no, it's not my network. Trust me.  As an aside, the SmartCam app is terrible on so many levels. Samsung's app development team needs to learn a thing or two about usability. It's pure trash, like it was cobbled together by a junior programmer.  Save your money and avoid this camera at all costs. Any camera that manages to lose its connection to your external viewing device nullifies the point.

The warning when you start up is that Picasa no longer functions but the truth is that ALL connection to Google is dead.

The alarm zones don't really work like they are advertised. I could go on, but to make a long story short, you're probably better off with a Dropcam.

Bia Johnson,1,"Nice camera on paper, TERRIBLE WiFi connectivity.",2015-06-29,Y,"This camera looks great on paper, but fails to deliver due to terrible wireless connectivity issues.  After comparing this camera to the Nest/Dropcam, we decided the Samsung was the way to go to avoid having to pay a subscription fee to store and record video.  The camera sits in our nursery and acts as the baby monitor.  When everything works, the video quality is great compared to the Foscam we were using previously.  The software is a little clunky to use, but nothing we couldn't adapt too.  The real deal breaker was the constantly dropping wireless connection.  We have a small 2 story house, with the WiFi access access point on the first floor, and the camera on the second floor.  The WiFi router is an ASUS RT-AC66U and provides strong reception in the room on all our smartphones and the Foscam that used to be there.  However, the Samsung had significant issues staying connected, despite everything we tried.  The video stream would unpredictably cut-out without any warning, and the android SmartCam client software isn't smart enough to reconnect on it's own, making it completely useless as a baby monitor.  After putting up with this thing for 9 months due to the sunk cost, it finally decided to spare us any more suffering by refusing to work at all.  The camera is now stuck in a boot loop, powering up then resetting itself every 30 seconds or so.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Looks great<br />Great video quality<br />Nice features for the price<br /><br />CONS:<br />Terrible WiFi connectivity<br />SmartCam does not auto-reconnect",1,1,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,2
Tania Rana Overall it&#39;s a very good product .we are saving so much ..,1,Do yourself a favor and dont buy this junk,2015-06-29,N,"Hate this camera. All it can do is just create the video and store in the SD card and provide a live stream, which is highly restrictive because nobody has patience to go onsite, get the card and play it back. Anyways, there are too many issues with this. Installation is a breeze. Weird thing is that only one device can view the video at a time from their browser login. If another viewer logs in from a browser, the original viewer is logged off automatically. Reflects really poor software design. Trying to stream this on blueiris or ispy or VLC will take 10s of man hours to enable (endless reading of other people's instructions on the internet), and in the end you'll lose a few hair. &#34;Gao&#34; on the amazon question & answer section says you can use net-i-ware but it'll ask you for your admin windows login and password.

Komal sarraf,2,Disappointment from a potentially nice product.,2015-06-24,Y,"I usually don't like to write negative reviews, but I'm hoping enough negative reviews will create positive change.  My main reason for getting this camera is that I could record video on the local SD card, but it would record sill images taken about every 10 seconds on the google drive/picassa.  I actually returned my first camera because the google drive option stopped working. Unfortunately, most other cameras save to a cloud for a very limited amount of time with a monthly fee. I want permanent storage.  Anyway, I bought another Smart Cam because on paper it seemed like what I wanted.  Well, after a week the new one also stopped uploading to google drive also.  This feature is important, because if someone steals the camera they also take all the video.  With the google drive feature, you will get a nice mug shot of whoever is taking the camera should that happen.  Or if the memory card fills up, or whatever.  Anyway, I called support (Samsung) and they didn't even call me back the first two times I called.  I was told they'd call me back within two hours. They did call me back the third time, (after I mentioned that nobody called me back the first two times).  I was told that the google drive feature was being worked on and would hopefully it be fixed in near future.  Today is June 24th and my last uploaded image was on May 20th.  I opened the Smart Cam app today and a message came up saying &#34;Due to google privacy polices the picassa/google drive feature is not working&#34; I felt that this was pretty unacceptable for such a large company (or any company) to advertise that a product does something, and then say &#34;Sorry about that. It's not working at the moment.  Stay tuned&#34;. It actually says &#34;Stay tuned for further updates.  I will adjust my review if things get fixed.

pratap singh,3,"excellent potential, but delivering satisfactory results",2015-06-24,Y,"I purchased this over a year ago and have purchased multiple cameras since. I can say that when the camera is working fine it is probably a 9 out of 10 rating.  However, there are too many bugs to name.  First, I've run into a problem with the cameras turning on and off on their own (cycling).  During that time they do not record anything--this problem occurs whether its plugged in or connected by WiFi. The software that runs the camera needs to be upgraded by Samsung.  The recording and SD card functioning are very good.  I like this much more than putting the recordings on a &#34;cloud&#34; that could get hacked etc....The 128 degree wide angle camera is awesome.  The camera does not record at 1080p as Samsung alludes to.  Recordings are at 720p....not that great.  You can view your cameras at 1080p.  Samsung has run into problems with some of its features that included viewing photo's that are upload to Google's Picassa (Photo site)  That feature has not been working in the last 30 days. ******a year ago we had an intruder in our home.  It did not appear anything had been missing from the home.  However, the photo feature helped me determine that the burglar had taken jewelry and I was able to forward this to police.  Customer support is HORRIBLE.  I could say a lot more here but Amazon has its censors.....  Overall, I am satisfied, but not happy.  I hope Samsung can improve upon the camera (it needs to)...., hire capable, courteous tech support staff that understand the product etc....and come up with better communication to its customers when a problem arises.

I was going to initially jump into the Dropcam ship but the recording fees turned me off. I have my own NAS storage space at home and thought of many ways to record myself but nothing came easy. I needed something easy - and then this came along.<br /><br />I bought it for $189 which is less than the $199 for the Dropcam HD. I also had/have to buy an SD Card for recording so it came out about $201 all together. Once I got it at home I quickly saw how easy it was to setup. My intentions were to do it wireless but that failed big time. I kept getting drop signals from the living room. I have a 2.4 and 5Ghz band on a default Verizon + Asus 1900Mbit router and still kept getting dropped. I began getting frustrated and was going to return this.<br /><br />I decided a wire is still the best option - and it is. I had to drill a hole for the ethernet to come to the camera - so it can look more professional (at home). The signal is now 100% all the time on and makes a huge difference.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about the camera is having to store/recording off-site. Imagine if someone steals the camera - where is the recording (in the SD Card!).

First, you have to register it with Samsung before it will work. Samsung then has all your account and camera log-in details (also your home network details!). This is ridiculous, and absolutely not necessary. Then, you must have a Google account (Picasa) to upload any images. So now Google has all your camera details, and access to all your videos/photos. Ridiculous times two! You CANNOT set it to upload images to your private email account - but both Google and Samsung have eyes and ears in your home. Your images can only go to Google. Ridiculous times three! Personally, I'd like a cam that ONLY I have access to, and I can share and configure as I please. I don't want Samsung or Google (or the NSA, or hackers) knowing anything at all about my camera, my living room, or anything at all of my or my family's personal life. I'm returning it.",2,1,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,1
Sam K.,4,Great camera but wifi unstable,2015-06-04,Y,"First off, I do like this camera a lot.  I have two of them set up in my house so I can watch my nanny with my kids.  The setup was simple and easy and the picture quality is acceptably clear though not on the order of an HDTV.  The wide angle view is great and is able to cover my entire living room and family room with little distortion.  I also like the fact that I don't have to subscribe to any paid service to be able to store my videos to either my iOS device or to an microSD card.<br />The reason I am deducting one star is because the WiFi function is a bit unstable.  I originally had both cameras hooked up to my WiFi and they both worked great.  But then one of them started to disconnect and reconnect off and on.  I replaced it with a new one but it did the same, so I had to use a cat6 ethernet cable to connect it to the router which then worked fine.  Not sure if I just got two bad batches or if this is a known issue with these cams.",0,0,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,2

Tech support filed a ticket and were supposed to get back with me.  About a month later, they were able to finally get me squared away.<br /><br />The camera works very well when it is connected, but it frequently disconnects (usually once every few minutes), making using it as a baby monitor a little cumbersome.

Software no longer works with my Mac laptop.  Apparently this is a common complaint.  When trying to contact samsung customer service, their webmaster rejects any emails from Yahoo or Gmail accounts.  Not very helpful.

Thank you,2015-05-18,Y,"This product works with your smartphone and tablets and pc, etc.  It does not &quot;pan&quot; however so you are stuck with where you aim it.  It does have a pretty wide angle for viewing but isn't moveable.  I find it a pain that it does not come with a memory card.  A compatible card should be included and the price adjusted if necessary. Samsung says it works with picassa but I have had great difficulty getting this to work.  I have used computers since the '70's so I know how this is supposed to work... but it doesn't.  The picture quality is stellar.  The software for viewing is great but a bit complicated. Motion sensing is very good and you can set up defined areas of detection which is innovative and works well.  This product is 90% there but the picassa, email, non-pan and no memory card make it less than an optimum situation.  I should think pan should be doable in software if not hardware.  A memory card should be included. Better instructions in use of google email and picassa should be addressed.

Anjali Ghosh,1,Do Not Buy If You Have An Apple Router!!,2015-05-16,N,"After reading numerous reviews, I decided to buy this security camera.  I like that you don't have to pay for monitoring and you can just use your own SD card, which does not come with the device.  You have to buy it separately.<br /><br />The problem is getting the camera to connect to your network. I followed all the instructions and tried to connect using my phone, iPad, and directly with my computer. I wasted an entire evening on this with no luck. I called customer service, was on hold for a long while, only to be answered by someone who took my name and number and said they were busy and would call me back within 1 hour,  but they never called. So, the following day, I called again and demanded to speak to someone and refused to wait on a return call that was never going to happen.<br /><br />Tech support was kind on the phone and tried to help.  We repeated everything I did the night before, but the camera would not connect to the network. The tech said it was because I have an Apple router. We had to update the software. He said Apple uses different characters that are not identified by the camera and the update should fix the problem. It did not.  We were on the phone a couple hours at least. That must be why it's so hard to get to speak to someone. Got disconnected, had to call back and explain everything again to another rep.<br /><br />The reps kept requesting that I allow them to remotely log into my computer to make some changes and maybe the camera would work. I consider that very dangerous and refused. That is how internet thieves steal your identity and personal information. These guys may be ethical, but you never really know what they may be doing in your computer.<br /><br />After all that wasted time and energy, the camera never would work with my router. I returned it.<br /><br />As a side note, I have a Drop Cam Pro and I love it. I just needed a second camera. It was effortless to connect to my network and provides clear beautiful images. I've been using it for one year with no problems. The only con to the Drop Cam is that you have to pay for monitoring. There's no SD slot for your own free monitoring. However, after what I went through with Samsung, I will gladly buy another Drop Cam and pay for monitoring.",2,1,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4

Rama,3,Expensive + Lagging motion detection,2015-05-15,Y,"The camera itself is well-made.  You get all 128° angle, 1080p quality on LTE or wifi connection faster than 7-10mbps download speed and I like the fact that it's really easy to setup and configure using the iOS SmartCam app on my iPhone 6+.  When purchasing this camera, think about which area you want to monitor/cover because it requires a power outlet.  I called a local electrician and the sole purpose was to install outlets to place the cameras in area that I wanted inside the house (1st floor entrance ceiling and 2nd floor closet ceiling).  We use to monitor our indoor entrance and our closet (valuables), since we have people coming over to do work inside the house from time to time.  Hence two cameras were almost $400 plus tax and installing the power outlet was no small task either.  You may also want to mount the camera where it's hard for people to reach/tamper.  Higher you place the camera, better your coverage will be so that's why I chose high ceiling corners.  Then again, it's a matter of personal preference.  SmartCam app lags about 45-60 secs with its motion detect notification.  I'm on LTE connection or with my cell data off our house wifi is at 20mbps and it still lags.  When viewing the camera there's about a 3-5secs delay.  Few seconds delay is inevitable but notification lag is somewhat annoying.  It's not IP cam but the beauty of this camera is that it's super easy to install, configure and use.  I use 64GB microSDXC on both cameras and it's good enough to have a crystal clear playback recording.  Two-way talk is not like a two-way walkie talkie; it's good enough to work but lags a lot and it's not as efficient as you want it to be; you have to enunciate every word and speak clearly.

Says connection error a lot when attempting to open app with phone, but I think that's because you lose service and connection when constantly moving and going places with your phone.  After it says that error, all I do is usually sign back in successfully, but it does get annoying constantly seeing that app error message pop up when opening the app.  A second sign in solves it usually.  It always saves good video and pictures when alerted to motion and audio and saves it to my Google account for later review.  I just wish the app alerted me to these vids/pics every time it happens... Sometimes the app alerts, sometimes it doesn't, but it always saves the vid/pic.  It is also very sensitive and even alerts and takes vids/pics of pieces of dust floating by and of shadows and reflections.  The camera actually saved so many event videos/pics to my Google account (over 5000) that I had to call Google and ask how to delete them all at once instead of one by one.  As for picassa and Google, it seems due to privacy issues, Samsung can't save anymore vid/pics there until their privacy issue is resolved... Whatever that means.  In conclusion, good camera.  If they ever get the smartcam app to alert to you 100% of the time, get it so the app stays connected and get that Google privacy issue solved so it can continue storing your event pics/vids, it will be better.",0,0,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,2

Especially technology that will be obsolete in a few months or in a year. I waited and waited until something worth to invest shows up in the market. I am willing to invest for the hardware, not in using the software.. Since when we as consumer allow this kind of companies steal and rip off our hard earned money ? Smartcam is multi functional device, you don't need Smarthub, Iris, the rest of models that need a hub (outside of an app) is a useless technology. Samsung is indeed a game changer..  The camera comes w motion sensor, e-mail forwarding, wide angle lense, adjustment of sensitivity, voice recorder, certain area you want to focus on traffics.. (Drop cam just recently released a motion detector).. so it depends of the area to cover, the wider it is the more benefits you'd get out of one Smartcam, for example an open kitchen living room area. I don't need a hub, install is a breeze via Android and samsung tablet. For me this is a great value investment, a few second lags don't really impact the rest of functionality. whet the difference one could make in viewing a few seconds later, night vision is clear, night photo resolution is hd quality.

saniya khan,4,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p review,2015-04-30,Y,"Nice WiFi camera. Fairly easy to set up, reasonable picture quality and functionality. The motion / audio sensing and alert works well. Live monitoring, and viewing event-triggered photos (stored on your Google+ account) and videos (stored on microSD card) from a remote location with the iPad is easy. If you are like me and pedantic about choosing meaningful and logical names then before setting the camera up be prepared with the following details: - you will need to create an account with Samsung - think of an account name and password. You can log in and access / view the camera(s) set up under this account using a web browser or the mobile / tablet app - so choose your password wisely; - you will need to give the camera(s) a name and also a password. Again, choose the password wisely; - you will need your wi-fi password during the set up process; - you will need your Google+ account details (if you want the event-triggered photos to be sent to your Google account for viewing in a browser or Google+ app).  Room for improvement: - boot up can be painfully slow (can take 1-2 mins to become functional); - question the claim of &#34;1080p Full-HD&#34; (live view default 640x360 @20 fps, can go upto 1280x720 @15 fps; event recording is 1280x720). Video resolution, quality and frame rate can do with an improvement; - it's a large camera (and white) so not exactly discreet. Can be smaller and neutral colours (or at least neutral, stick-on decals) will help.",1,1,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4
Amazon Customer,3,) The video quality is quite good (including night vision) and the Picasa image capture is ...,2015-04-30,Y,"I have five of these cameras, sort of set up on a whim. The camera itself seems okay, although I had the issues mentioned on one with a 64GB card (I just put a 32GB card in that one and moved on.) The video quality is quite good (including night vision) and the Picasa image capture is a nice touch. I had trouble with the Wifi connection being unstable, but resolved that.<br /><br />Where I really had and still have a problem is the software. The website especially is completely intolerant of dropped packets, making it impossible to review captured video over a less-than-perfect network link. I would also like a way to download the captured video, but thus far I've not found one. (It's not terribly useful if all the captures are stuck in the camera.)<br /><br />For watching live video, at least, a workaround is to view the RTSP streams directly. I've had good luck with using VLC for that, although you do have to know enough to set up your network so that you can reach the camera from where-ever you are. The URL is &#34;rstp://admin:password@IP.ADDRESS:554/profile5/media.smp&#34; -- you can replace &#34;profile5&#34; with lower numbers for lower quality - I use profile2 when things are worst. )<br /><br />It works.. and it works reasonably well, but I really wish the software was better. There's no real need for it to live on a third party web page in the first place (I guess to handle relay mode), and it needs to be a lot more tolerant of packet loss. The ability to download the video would be a &#34;very nice to have&#34;, too.

Anirban,4,a camera that is easy to set up (even without a hard-wired connection,2015-04-23,Y,"Finally, a camera that is easy to set up (even without a hard-wired connection!) and saves video locally (free)! I have tried Drop Cam, D-Link, Foscam and Belkin but they were either too difficult to set up or I couldn't store and review video without paying extra. Belkin was the only other camera I liked except for the lack of storage. I am using the San Disk memory card, not the one from Samsung. I access it remotely via an iPhone or iPad, or a Windows-based computer.<br /><br />I do wish the Samsung SmartCam came in black, had a more discrete profile, and that the quick-start guide contained a URL to find the full user manual online. Although I don't have a need to mount the camera to a wall and haven't tried to connect the wall mount kit to the base, I don't see enough pieces to make that work and there are no instructions. I failed to find the user guide on the Samsung website at first, but stumbled upon it indirectly by shopping for the product and then clicking on the support link at https://www.samsungsmartcam.com/web/.<br /><br />I also wish that I could delete saved recordings from the SD card without having to reformat the card (thus wiping out everything), and that I could program the notification times via the app (I can only do this from the web).<br /><br />I have only had the camera set up for about a week but I have already accessed the live cam and stored video from the app while I was in a different state. I also reviewed the stored video (also through the app) when I got back to make sure nothing nefarious happened while I was gone. That's what I was looking for in a camera and I finally found it in the Samsung SmartCam HD Pro. I still need to find the right sensitivity setting because I got a few false events that looked like they were caused by cloud cover -- moving onto or off of the sun.<br /><br />On the down side, I have been having problems viewing the stored video remotely from the Samsung website on a computer. I get this message: “Access has failed. Please try again in a moment (simultaneous connection/network unstable).” I don’t know if that’s from the computer I’m using or my home wi-fi. I don’t find the website to be all that intuitive.<br /><br />So far I am happy with this camera. Other than the Belkin, it's the only other camera that I haven't wanted to send back the same day I got it. Now I just need to figure out how to get the stored video to back-up to MyCloud and I'll be extremely happy!",0,0,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4

Tularam,4,Updated: Once again a great camera.,2015-04-22,N,"I very rarely write reviews (and when I do it's to give positive reviews), but I felt it important to let people know what they getting if they purchase this camera. The camera itself works exactly as advertised. In fact, we were extremely pleased with the camera and the iOS apps that go with it for several months until the recent app update. We would turn the SmartCam app on one of our iPhones or iPads and set it on the nightstand and have a great monitor all night long for our baby girl. We could monitor her from anywhere and when we travelled, connecting the camera to another wi-fi was no problem.  The latest update put a 5-minute timeout on the camera - rendering it completely useless for use as a baby monitor...WHICH IS WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS DESIGNED TO BE! After five minutes, monitoring shuts off and you have to re-connect to the camera. There seems to no way around this timer function. If we had known beforehand that this would happen, we never would have purchased this camera. Too bad, because otherwise, it's a great product.  If they update the app and get rid of the ridiculous timer function, I will change this review. Until then - stay away from this product.

It might be good for some, but cybersecurity-wise, I don't think it is good. Private key for camera is just 8 bytes, all readable/printable chars, so 64-bit key consisting of printable chars. I overall didn't like this part at all, so I completely blocked internet access for this camera in my firewall. I enabled only local (LAN) access, so I have to tunnel (VPN) into my network to access cameras. * Quality isn't good enough for 1080p * I was expecting a little better UI and management tool for the product based on price tag * No plugin for Linux, you can't watch videos in your browser in Linux, you have to enter RTSP url manually in VLC.

Shobhit Kumar,1,Unreliable software. Nice hardware. Not for mission-critical use.,2015-04-04,Y,"Not a day goes by that I don't hate this video monitor. I've had this thing for 9 months and I use it every day. The only reason it hasn't gotten tossed is that I sometimes want the wide field of view (twins), and I can hear the babies from anywhere in the house anyway, so I just use it to check if they are really awake.<br />The tech specs are fine. The picture is good. But it is extremely unreliable in the following ways:<br />1. The monitoring software on my android (Samsung Galaxy S3) and Apple (iPad, iPad mini, iPhone 5) cuts out at random times, displaying a &#34;network connection lost&#34; message. This happens after a few seconds, a few minutes, or sometimes it'll run for a whole hour. There is no audible notification that it's offline, so the only way to know is to be staring at it, or to check it every few minutes. This makes it completely unsuitable for a night-time baby monitor.<br />2. The record on motion and record on sound options are very primitive, and even on the most sensitive setting (which is not obvious because it's a slider labeled, unhelpfully, &#34;1 - 5&#34;)  it doesn't pick up our babies rolling around or making noises that are clearly audible on the monitor.<br />3. The system requires you to log into Samsung's servers. (That alone is outrageous). If their servers are down, or your internet is down, you can't use this camera at all. Also, their apps are so buggy that when they pop up a message to tell you the system will be down for maintenance the app then crashes and you can't use the monitor.",4,3,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,3

Prajna routray,5,Very cool!!,2015-04-02,Y,"I've only had it for one day, but I'm very happy so far!  I had ordered a Foscam on a whim, but after reading about needing a computer to set them up, which I don't have, and after reading that they are hard to set up unless you are computer savvy I decided Foscam was not for me. Them I discovered the SmartCam. I saw how easy it is to set up and how all you need is a phone or tablet app to set it up (and obviously a router).  So I decided to buy one.<br /><br />The video quality is really good, and the wide field of view is awesome. When I first set it up, looking out my window, the blowing pine trees set off the motion sensor like crazy. Then I turned the motion sensor all the way down, and it didn't go off from the trees. The road is about 50 yards from my house, and cars going by and people walking on the road set the motion sensor off. Very nice!  I live in the mountains and I'm excited to see the motion sensor pick up animals.<br /><br />It's too bad that you cannot use the camera to look out a window at night. The IR just shines a bright reflection against the window. But that's not this SmartCams fault. That's just the way it is.<br /><br />I drove about 35 miles away to the city and was worried that I wouldn't get a connection on the cell phone app. Well, my worries were extinguished.

Pretty easy to install and use the mobile apps. For the first week we had it, it worked great. Now it can't even hold a connection for longer than 5 minutes. We use this as our baby cam, so after the first week of use, we really started to rely on it. One night, the camera went down (the blue LED light stayed on, meaning it wasn't connected). I called Samsung customer support, and was told they were too busy to take my call and would call back within an hour (which they never did). I called back 2x and insisted on speaking with someone who could help. The customer &#34;service&#34; person on the phone became snarky and condescending. I told him how surprised I was with his attitude and that I may return it and purchase another camera. After all of this, he finally mentions that Samsung was having a server problem, and all the cams were experiencing it (why he didn't tell me that upfront, I'll never know). The server did start working 24 hours later. But now, the connection cuts out every couple minutes. I don't even want to bother calling customer &#34;service&#34; again, and if this problem persists for another 24 hours, then I'll just return it and get a Dropcam (even though I hate the idea of the cloud storage charge, I need a camera that works reliably).

Deepa,3,"Beautiful image quality, but delayed video and can't stay connected to my wireless network.",2015-03-24,Y,"I have really mixed emotions about this camera.  It has (in my very limited experience) unparalleled picture quality and the wide angle is amazing.  The main reason I purchased this camera was because it was said to work with Blue Iris and I wouldn't have to pay the monthly fees such as with Dropcam, or send my videos out to the cloud where I no longer control what happens to them.  Not that anyone is going to care to watch my dog counter surfing when he thinks no one is looking, but the principle still bugs me.  I didn't care for the cloud functionality that came with this camera either, for the same reasons, but at least I don't have to use it (the camera comes with firmware with some limited functionality that's useful if you don't have any other software handy) and I don't have to pay a monthly fee!<br /><br />Now for the down side--I found this camera incredibly difficult to get working with Blue Iris, although I finally did after spending probably 20 hours crawling the web looking for information and playing with the settings in Blue Iris.  Finally that would have been perfect but this is when I learned the camera cannot keep a stable connection to my wireless network and the signal is dropped over 50% of the time, even using the in-camera firmware.<br /><br />Another issue is the FPS is extremely low with Blue Iris (less than 1!) so even when I have an image it's pretty much useless.  But viewing the video on the camera firmware it's reasonable.  That may be a failing of Blue Iris, so I didn't take any stars off for it.  But I did take a star off for the 5-7 second delay in the video, even with the firmware, which greatly reduces the effectiveness of my response to my dog's actions.<br /><br />So yeah, I've learned a few unpleasant facts about my dog's behavior but unfortunately without a fast, stable connection access to the video, there's not much I can do about it since my corrections are late and frequently don't happen at all.  Sadly, I feel like I wasted my money.",3,3,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,1
Jyotsna yadav,3,Great camera. Remote and internal software could be better.,2015-03-23,Y,"Really like this but wish they would update the remote viewing software. Would like to zoom in on areas when viewing recorded material. Also, when set to only record after recognizing movement or sound, even if the sound or movement continues the recording is NOT continuous. It records approx. 15/20 seconds then starts another clip.<br />Also, I can't explain the way it is done, but there were several other &#34;viewers&#34; by other companies that offered a noticeably clearer image, but sadly had many other shortcomings that left me with only the Samsung product to use affectively.

As a long haul truck driver, my family was constantly wondering where in the country I was & what the weather was like, particularly when they the news reported bad storms.  I thought about purchasing a dash cam, but decided against it as that would not provide my family with a real time live view. So I went looking for a high quality HD 1080p wifi camera and found this one. It  connects directly to my wifi hotspot. It only uses data when someone connects to it with the free app. I can have as many as 10 people connected a the same time. I can insert a 64gig micro SD card and store 24 hours on a continuous loop. Since purchasing this camera my family worries about me a lot less.

Ranjeet singh,5,Very impressed. Great Baby monitor and security camera.,2015-03-16,N,"I have both Dropcam and the Samsung Smart Cam.  I use the Dropcam for garage security. I use the Samsung for my Baby monitor. I was concerned that remote viewing was going to be an issue. But their smartphone app made it seemless. I can view my baby or my room from anywhere I have data coverage. Very impressed with how easy it was to set up.  I wish the camera had a tripod mount at the bottom, this way I can attach this to a Gorilla pod or Tripod.  Also the live feed cuts out every now and then.  A bit annoying. For the price and quality, it's hard to beat. Just a simple note on comparison between Dropcam and Smartcam.  Dropcam's cloud service is unmatched. easy to review 1 week worth of videos and sends you notifications to your phone when there is movement during the day. The downside: There is a fee for the cloud service and they only record in 720p. which is not good for detail.  Samsung system is very easy to setup and can view your Camera from anywhere, but it's difficult to review your 1 weeks worth of footage, if you are using it for home security. The upside is: There is no monthly fee, 1080p video. and the app is good enough.  The camera does get very hot to the touch.  This is really good baby monitor or just a simple home monitoring system. ------ Update ------- I've been using their Web Application to monitor the camera and it's pretty amazing. Much more control and options on the web app than the smart phone app. I can control all the setting remotely and view past recordings. You can also format the sd card from your browser. Very powerful system.",5,4,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,4

Sara kabeer,3,I've had to do a lot of hacking to get this camera to do what I want...,2015-03-13,Y,"UPDATE: After a couple months of use without any downtime, I realize now that the camera is just very sensitive to crappy WiFi signals. I was causing my own issues by updating/upgrading my WiFi network while expecting the camera to remain active, and if my WiFi went into a quirky state for a while, the camera would be non-functional until I manually reset it.  In the end, the camera does what I wanted it to do, with a lot of effort and twiddling.  UPDATE: After about a week of use (with the camera configured to send alerts via email during certain hours when it detected motion), the camera stopped working. When I looked at the camera, instead of having the steady green LED that I'd grown accustomed to seeing upon entering the secured area I saw a steady blue LED. I powered down and then powered up the device and after the boot cycle and a short time it returned to a green light, but only until the next evening when it had stopped working again. When I looked at the LED this time it was a flashing blue. I rebooted it again and the camera entered a green state once again. I tried to connect to it (with an Android device) and the connection failed and the LED went blue.  Right now I've powered it down to see if perhaps the heat (it gets warm!) is an issue and I'll try one more time, tonight, to make sure that the camera can remain operational while simultaneously running a constant network check from another device (just to rule out the wifi router, which I have serious doubts is the issue).  Either way, it's looking like this device may not be suitable as a security camera, which is what it is marketed for (and the reason I purchased it).  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Most of my frustration with this camera have been with its software. Clearly the developers had some ambitious goals, and what they came up with was just barely enough for me to take what they've done and extend the camera for my own purposes.  First and foremost: the power cord is not long enough for my needs, andI'm not yet sure what I'm going to be able to do about that. I would love to be able to acquire a white 10-foot DC power extension cable specifically for this unit. For now I've broken out the AC extension cords and eventually I'll probably have to hire an electrician to put a power outlet in a more convenient location.  I was expecting that the software would be comparable to the lower-quality, less-expensive Samsung SmartCam SNH-1011, which claims to record thirty-second video clips to Google Drive, but this one doesn't. Instead, it will upload snapshot images to Google+ or email them to an arbitrary address. So I don't get videos, I get images, and I get them in Email, not in Google Drive. I can live with that.  How secure are the email transmissions of the messages that are being sent? Gmail claims to receive them after having negotiated an encrypted channel using SSLv3  and the ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA with 128/128 bits. Not bad; an attacker would need to figure out a new key for every transmission and because it's using forward secrecy.  Now, about that receiving messages in email rather than uploading them into Google Drive? Thank goodness for Apps Script! Here's the script I've developed to have the camera abide by a Google Calendar in order to know when it's okay to save a copy and send another alert...  function CheckForAlerts() {   var CalendarID = 'Insert your Calendar ID here';   var DriveFolder = 'Insert the Folder ID that you want to stick the images into';   var AlertList = ['Add an alert address here'];    var cal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(CalendarID);   var now = new Date();   var events = cal.getEvents(new Date(now.getTime()),   new Date(now.getTime() + 60000));    var camOn = true;   if(events.length == 0) {     camOn = false;   }    var alertThreads = GmailApp.search('subject:&#34;Event Alarm&#34;');   if(alertThreads.length == 0) {     return;   }    var driveFolder = DriveApp.getFolderById(DriveFolder);    for(var i = 0; i &#60; alertThreads.length; ++i) {     var thread = alertThreads[i];     var messages = thread.getMessages();     for(var j = 0; j &#60; messages.length; ++j) {       var message = messages[j];        if(camOn) {         var body = message.getBody();         var timestamp = body.split(' ')[2].split(' ')[2];         var attachment = message.getAttachments()[0];         var file = driveFolder.createFile(attachment);         file.setName(timestamp + '.jpg');         var url = file.getUrl();          var content = body.replace(' ', '\n') + '\nDrive URL: ' + url;          for(var k = 0; k &#60; AlertList.length; k++) {           MailApp.sendEmail(AlertList[k], 'Home Alert', content);         }       }        message.moveToTrash();     }   } }  And I have the above code running on a once-a-minute schedule.  The other thing to know is that I've added a filter to my Gmail mailbox so that when the messages with subject:&#34;Event Alarm&#34; arrive, they're automatically archived so they don't show up in my inbox.  End result from all of this is images in Drive, where I want them, and _not_ in my mailbox.  Additional notes: I'm not using the uploading to Google+ feature anymore: I was quite displeased that it did not negotiate an OAuth grant but instead required that I provide an Application Specific Password, which is essentially a hole poked into my two-factor authentication scheme.",8,8,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,3

Yatin D.,5,Good Camera,2015-03-13,Y,"Product: Samsung Smartcam Pro SNH-P6410<br />The camera works as advertised.  The low light performance, video quality and wide angle viewing is excellent.

Considering how slow the internet is on those ships, I was very pleased. The motion detection and alert works great.  Setting it up was somewhat hard, but after a lot of reading I got it right.  The only real problem I had during setup was getting Picasa to work. It kept saying I had the wrong google user name or password.  Tried the two step method many times to no avail.  Finally I signed up for a new google account and it accepted it.  I then downloaded the  Picasa Tool App and was able to see all the recorded snapshots taken when motion was detected.

Tharun,1,"Great camera, utterly horrible software!",2015-03-06,Y,"I understood when I bought this camera that it was going upload images / video to Samsung, over the internet, so that they could then be downloaded and viewed on my mobile device(s) while I was away from home. And it can do that, privacy issues aside (see the 4-star review by Joe R.) But most people don't have enough upload bandwidth to do that with any real picture quality. Usually, upload speeds are a fraction of your download speeds, at least here in the US, so the software automatically reduces image quality to accommodate for upload speeds.<br /><br />But I bought the camera hoping that I could disable it's “phone home” capability and use it privately on my home network. And it turns out that you can do that, if you use it hardwired. Then, simply using Firefox (even under Linux), MSIE, Safari, maybe others, and a simple URL, (no plugins from Samsung required), you can get a beautiful 1920x1080 still images or even video.<br /><br />The first time I tried to use the camera, I followed the instructions and created an account with Samsung and downloaded their plugin... During setup, they will ask you to create a “private key” which Samsung sets as the 'admin' login password for the camera. It took a little sleuthing to find the camera's IP address (as it was DHCP assigned), but once you have that, just hit the camera's IP address with a WEB browser and you'll get a login screen. Use the private key as the password, and there is just (barely) enough software there to configure the camera with a static IP address. I also set non-existent IP addresses for the Gateway and DHCP servers (which keeps the camera from using the internet, but also prevents it from setting date/time). (Note: wireless can only use DHCP).<br /><br />Once you have a static IP address, you can hit the camera with simple HTTP requests. For example, if I assign the camera an IP address of 10.0.0.2 and type in the following URLs:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />you will see a login screen (no parameters), or be rewarded with stunning 1920x1080, wide angle, stills (jpg) or video (mjpg). Specify 1 for the resolution and you'll get 1280x1024 images.<br /><br />It turns out that, under the hood, the camera is running some version of Linux and you can configure the camera using HTTP requests and a WEB browser. The problem is finding the Samsung document that describes the interface. (I never found anything specifically for this camera, but many of the commands used to control dozens of other Samsung cameras also work with this camera). The documentation suggest there might be many possible ways to use this camera, including the capability to upload images to an FTP server after motion detection, possibly upon motion detection with facial recognition?<br /><br />Shame on Samsung for not providing software to control all of these features or to use it within your private local area network!  If you've ever used Panasonic cameras, you'll be horribly disappointed with the software provided by Samsung.<br /><br />I also recommend reading the 5-star review by Paulo H, Dr.Sc in Astrobiology, which discusses controlling the camera with rtsp as well as using iSpy with the camera. There are several reviews that discuss finding the Samsung Network Device API -- I never found anything specifically for this camera, only other cameras Samsung has made.<br /><br />Update: lowering to one because it crashes so often.",55,52,Samsung SmartCam HD Pro 1080p Full-HD Wi-Fi Camera,3

I have a very stable WIFI network and internet connection, but this camera is continually dropping my connection. I didn't pay enough attention to the other reviews that mention that. It drops your connection and does not reconnect. It also sends your video up to Samsung (which is probably why it drops - unreliable servers). Also note that you cannot view multiple cameras simultaneously on an Android or iPhone. When I called in to their technical help, I got a guy with a ton of attitude who was trying to tell me the problem is on my end. When I explained that the internet connection shouldn't matter if both the camera and my viewing device are on my WIFI, he attempted to explain to me that my WIFI is the internet. Wow, really? I will be returning the 2 cameras I bought. UPDATE: I replaced 2 of these with Dropcam HD's; they are very stable and work great!

Ñoor jahan begum,4,Easy to install with just an iphone,2015-03-05,Y,"My house got broken into and later my gate to my backyard was found busted open so I decided it was time for a camera system. I love this one and will be adding at least 2 additional to cover other parts of my house.  In summary it's an awesome Camera with great image quality and super easy to setup with just an iphone. You have no recurring fee and can record many days of video on a SD card that you can access at anytime from anywhere with an app on your phone.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because the app still seems buggy, it doesn't seem to be picking up any motion events, and the firmware update process wasn't intuitive.<br /><br />Set-up was super easy because it has wi-fi direct meaning you don't have to connect it to your router via cable to set it up.  My router is hidden in the back of a high cabinet so this was great for me to not have to climb up there to connect it with a cable.  I just installed the app and it walked me through the steps to set it up. I came home on my lunch break and had it working in less than 10 minutes. I did have to update the firmware which wasn't intuitive. I kept getting a pop up notification to update the firmware and finally clicked on it but there should have been a status bar to show the firmware was being updated and how much more time it is going to take.<br /><br />Image quality - is incredible. I have it in my front facing window and can see my front walkway, driveway and all the way across the street to 3 neighbors homes. There is glare at night but the image quality was better for me when I turned the night setting and indicator light off. The image is very crisp and clear and I can identify people walking across the street.<br /><br />Alerts - I get a lot of alerts when I first wake up with my newborn but just turn the sensitivity down when it bugs me. It's really for your safety so it's not a big deal to me.<br /><br />Playback - is amazing. It creates a list of sound events or you can watch continuously any time of day. I was notified when a solicitor came to the door while I was at work, when my mailman came to deliver mail and my dogfood. It's awesome to see what happens at my house when I am away.<br /><br />The app seems to have bugs.  If I try to playback an event from the same day I have to click on a previous day in order to see the options I have for playback.<br /><br />The motion detector has not been working since I updated the firmware.  I get no motion activity or alerts at all so I am going to call Samsung to troubleshoot.  All of my alerts have been sound alerts because my dogs bark every time someone comes to our house.<br /><br />I highly recommend this camera overall.oor while I was at work, when my mailman came to deliver mail and my dogfood.

Aayushi yadav,1,Use as a nightime Baby Monitor? - Don't.,2015-08-17,N,"I've set up my SmartCam as a video monitor for my baby. Many of the reviews are comments on the Samsung Privacy Agreement and using their servers to capture video, &#34;Big Brother watching&#34; type comments. Because I accepted that agreement with little hesitation, my review will focus on performance and experience. After all if anyone really wants to hack into my system and watch a baby sleep, go right ahead :)...<br /><br />I was initially impressed by the performance of the video camera. Because the recordings are server based, we were able to monitor our baby from anywhere from our phone, which was a fun feature. I could even pop on and see how baby was napping in her crib during the middle of the day at work, though not all that useful if I'm honest. The video clarity was great on the normal mode, better than any normal baby monitor, and only with about a 1-2 second lag from real-time. On HQ mode, the video quality was excellent but the lag increased to about 3-4 seconds. Not a huge problem, but could be a concern if your baby gets his/her arm stuck in the crib or something, and you want to get there ASAP...<br /><br />But now that my baby is a bit older (4 months) she's sleeping on her own in her crib through the night. Instead of just using the monitor while we're awake, to monitor naps and such, now we wanted to use it overnight to wake us if she woke up. We open up the viewer on one of our phones and put it on the nightstand... Every night we wake up to error messages and &#34;connection lost&#34; messages! Was our baby crying during the night? we don't know because we don't know how long the monitor was actually working.

Rayeesa,2,Don't waste your time...buy a real security camera.,2015-08-14,Y,"I will start off by saying that we had some things stolen from our house and we purchased the wink home sensor from quirky (GE) and it was great for notification but didn't incorporate a camera. So we opted to get this camera based on reviews from coworkers. For the first 2 and a half weeks, it was great. I learned that turning the audio detection on instead of motion detection was a much more efficient method for monitoring as the motion sensor picks up changes in lighting.  With more interactions with the neighbors that stole from us, we decided to just get a security system.  With the two paired, we had the perfect setup for our home... we thought.  Instead, for the last 2 weeks, we have had to connect the camera nearly every other day and the application on the phone is struggling with connection. The app keeps saying that the server is updating and may not be available, however when I checked with my coworkers, they are not experiencing the same thing.  It is spotty at best and I just leave it run now. I don't receive notifications but it has been recording events.  Not very intuitive software.

The save to google drive feature works quite well and it might be enough to make this camera a keeper if you can live with the two issues mentioned below.  Everything else about this camera falls short even for the $59 price.<br /><br />1.  Resolution & Field of View<br />It's a low res cam (VGA) as you probably already know but you may not know that the viewing angle is only 60 degrees.  You would need more than two of these cameras to match Samsung's SmartCam HD  at 128 degrees.  Compare to Drop Cam's standard (Gray) cam at 107 degrees and the Dropcam Pro at 130 degrees this camera falls short and may not be wide enough for your use case.<br /><br />2.  Horrible wifi (signal detection)<br />It's not more horrible than the Samsung SmartCamHD (I have tested both) but that's not saying much.  This camera needs to be quite close to your WAP to get a signal strong enough to ensure reliable video.  I have a large space to fill and have Nighthawk A6's, arguably the best WAP's on the market, serving up stairs and downstairs.  My SmartCam's have a hard time finding the signal from my upstairs A6 and my upstairs SmartCam's have a hard time seeing the signal from my downstairs A6 (and my R7000's for that matter)<br /><br />Net/Net I picked this up due to low price but when compared to Today's camera's with field of view in excess of 100 degrees the 60 degrees and VGA resolution and terrible wifi strength make this camera less than optimal and I'd even say negates the value price.",2,2,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,1

Jenifer stalin,4,Satisfied Customer - Pet Cam,2015-03-17,Y,"Works great for what I use it for (watching the dogs while I'm at work).  I have both inside looking out through windows, one on the back patio and one aimed to the yard.  I think the video quality is very good, and I can hear when the dogs bark.  It gives me peace of mind.  It tends to drop out often, but that could be my 3G availability at my desk in the middle of the building.  I probably wouldn't pay the full $150 price for one of these, but the refurbished ones work great.  Both worked right out of the box, and the app works fine on my Walmart Android Tracfone.  I wouldn't use it as a full-on security system, but for a baby cam or pet cam, it's a great buy.  I haven't tried watching on the computer website yet (www.samsungsmartcam.com/web) but I will try soon.  I also don't bother with the alerts.  That's not what I bought it for...<br /><br />P.S.

Amazon Customer,1,I like Samsung products but this camera does not deliver what ...,2015-01-27,Y,"Quite honestly don't buy it. I am being very objective, I like Samsung products but this camera does not deliver what I promises. First, when you plug the power cord the whole camera goes up side down due to it carries the whole weight of the cord, so you are not able to keep it steady like it shows in the photo here advertised. Second, there is no on/off button, so you need to either keep it plug it all time or when you plug it off it will take you to re do the whole set up every time . Yes, every time you plug it it, you have to wait a lot and then do the whole set up to get access. It is a pain. Software works fine, I have to tell when you follow steps the configuration goes well. App has no problems and it works fine. But the issue is that night vision simply does not exist, so for baby monitor, it sucks. No image at all in the dark.

Amazon Customer,4,Pretty good for the cost. Definitely not as bad as others say.,2014-12-17,Y,"For the money this is a great deal. I am rating this based on the cost and the advertised features, not holding it to the standards of cameras that cost 3X the amount like other people love to do. I'll bullet out a few things:    PROS:   - Pretty decent quality considering the cost of the camera   - Viewing angle is decent, as advertised.   - Mobile app is convenient although it definitely needs some work with notifications.   - Setup is simple for anyone who knows their way around a PC and basic hardware.   - Looks great, mounting hardware/mechanism is much better than expected.   - Google Drive setup was pretty easy (once I noticed the pop ups during the authentication process were being blocked). There's a way to set this up on the mobile app as well but I didn't try it.   - Email notifications work well BUT require you to share some of your personal Gmail info (this needs to be addressed, unless I'm missing something here - See CONS below for more details)   - Alarm scheduling feature is nice, but is not available through the mobile app    CONS:   - Mobile App needs some work    1. Notifications through the app directly to android are flakey and unreliable at best    2. Cannot adjust notification schedule through the app. Always on will result in massive amounts of storage use on Google Drive if you're using this feature.   - I have not figured out a way to get this to work with my Vera controller as of yet, although it may be possible.   - Status light is very big, bright and obvious if you're look for the camera to be less noticeable (this is very minor but worth noting).   - It needs your gmail username and password to use the email notifications and snapshots feature (Using the Google Drive feature does NOT need your password). Apparently the software uses Googles APIs and your own email address instead of Samsung hosting and email server for notifications. Setting up a dummy gmail account would work as well and keep you from having to provide you primary email account info.   - There REALLY needs to be a HOME and AWAY mode in the mobile app for this so you can easily control when to record activities and when to ignore. This seems like obvious necessary functionality but it simply does not exist for some unknown reason.   - The software (mobile and web app) have a few parts that are not very intuitive and could definitely be improved for a better user experience.    Overall I'd give it 3.5/5 (rounded to 4) as it works pretty well for the cost.",0,0,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4

It takes 10x more time to connect than Foscam, and runs for short time before breaking. Sometimes it runs for longer time but enables some Relay mode where you are unable to use microphone, and it increases the lag even more.  the app settings are a joke: You cannot change settings on the fly like on a real IP camera app but always have to exit then change settings and then wait long time for the app to reconnect. Even IR light toggle requires reconnect. Finally, motion detection is something you always need to enable/disable in settings and go back to the app and there is no time settings for motion detection. It really is unusable motion detection.    If you want a camera with easy Google Drive/Youtube upload on motion/alarm detection buy this camera - Foscam or any PC webcam (through various PC programs) will take hours time to setup something like that, that's not worth spending.

priya,1,Can't save video to Google Dropbox,2014-11-06,N,"Worked great at first when Samsung allowed saving video to Youtube but then that was replaced by Google Dropbox.  But even then not every video was recorded to Youtube; some events were recorded and some weren't.  It's not saving videos to Google Dropbox; I could only get it to save a photo (which usually doesn't show the person because the timing is off).  Samsung tech said something is wrong with their firmware and they are working on it.  Well until then I'm returning this.  CONS: - 5 fps - not saving video - Ever since Samsung replaced Youtube with Dropbox, I keep getting disconnected to my cameras. - Google Dropbox 2-factor verification is a pain in the ass. ---------------- 3/7/2015 update: The &#34;Samsung SmartCam HD SNH-E6411BN Full HD 1080p WiFi Camera&#34; is so much better and it works.",1,0,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4
Deeptiranjandas,5,easy set up. perfect for watching mom when i am out and about.,2014-11-05,Y,"I use this camera to check on my elderly mother through my android cell phone.  I bought a refurbished camera .. it looked new to me when I opened the box and it works perfectly!  im thinking of getting 2 more , one for the kitchen and one for the hallway.  if you read the directions, it only takes a minute or 2  to set up.  you plug it into your router or modem only for set up.  also your phone has to be on the same wifi. after naming it and putting in the mac address,  then just move it to the room or area you want to observe. after downloading the ap to you phone ( or computer), then you can easily access the camera from anywhere ... the mall , another state, etc. as long as your wifi and electricity are on.  I choose this one  because it has 2 way communication ( you need to set the volume or you may think its not working well) and plugs into the wall instead of running on batteries.  it does not rotate, which might not work in some situations, depending on the area.  it it perfect for me as my mom is not up and running all over the house.

Harika,1,This product doesn't do what it claims it can do. Isn't that false advertising?,2014-10-30,Y,"My experience with this camera was an exercise in frustration. This camera was advertised as being able to upload 30 second videos to Google Drive when motion or sound &#34;events&#34; occurred. I followed all instructions involving authorizing the device on both the chrome browser and the iPhone/iPad app, but I kept receiving errors (&#34;unable to save&#34; and &#34;upload failed&#34;). I contacted Samsung customer service several times regarding this issue, they attempted to fix the issue by remotely operating my computer and they were unable to fix the issue. These calls invariably ended with them claiming that a supervisor would call me back to fix the issue, but the supervisor would never call back. I became very frustrated and called one more time last week. They finally told me the issue was on their end and involved their servers, for which they said they would be issuing a server update and/or firmware update this week. It has been over a week and they didn't fix the issue. I only have one week left to return it, so I am returning it.",1,0,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4

The first one came with the model number of the camera as the serial number, and after about a half hour on the phone with Samsung, was told to return it to them for repair.  Umm... no?  Back to Amazon it went for replacement.  Second one came and was able to get it to show in the installer window with the correct serial number, but when I tried to go to the next step to configure it to the wireless, it kept saying invalid serial number or not connected (even though it was showing up on the screen!).  Spent another half hour with Samsung support, and was again told to send it in for repair.<br /><br />I was not real thrilled to have to give Samsung rights to view the stream, and that it was ALL through the samsung website, but for the purpose I was using the camera for, it was ok.<br /><br />I was going to give it  two stars for the fast shipping and quick resolutions with Amazon, but I do NOT recommend this product, and to be honest I don't think anyone should put a camera in their home that they are giving someone they don't know complete privileges to.  There is really no way to secure this camera for privacy.  Go with something different.",7,5,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,5
Sumit sirohi,2,Nice when it works,2014-10-15,Y,"I bought this camera after my apartment was broken into and burglarized. I wanted a camera that was affordable, wireless, accessible from my smartphone, cloud based and RELIABLE. This camera hit every mark except the reliability I was counting on. It was relatively easy to set up with the exception that it took 24 hours to finally log into my Google account. I kept getting &#34;failed to save&#34; error messages when attempting to log in during the setup.Then 24 hours later I got an email stating it had finally logged in.<br /><br />When this camera is connected it is pretty neat. Good image quality, good enough night vision, and it sends notifications when it alerts movement or sound, which you have the option to have both trigger an &#34;event&#34;, or one or the other. When connected I was able to see that my dog walker came on time to walk my dog. It takes a still photo and sends it to Picasa on Google, which I was able to view from the mobile app and gives you an option to view the live feed right away. While viewing the live feed you can take more pictures by hitting a photo button which are also uploaded to Picasa. So if the intruder sees the camera and destroys it or unplugs it from the power outlet, the pictures are already in Picasa. So when it works, it's cool......<br /><br />That being said, it was connected approx 30% of the time that I had it. It was approx 12 feet from my router so connectivity should not have been an issue, but it was. Also a big issue, whenever the camera picked up movement and alerted me via mobile app that an &#34;event&#34; was happening, the camera would lose connectivity and go off line. So if there was an intruder, you only had about 15 seconds before the camera would drop connection, thus not giving you much time to observe and take more pictures. I did not get Google Drive set up well enough to view strips of video.<br /><br />So I have returned the camera through Amazon and already received my refund. Amazon's refund policy is excellent. I have ordered a Dropcam and plan to purchase the year long $99 subscription for their online program. The peace of mind is worth it to me and I am hoping I have a better experience.",1,1,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4

It arrived in great condition and you would never know it was refurbished. We had some trouble setting it up only because it came with two sets of directions, only one of which worked and we didn't realize for a while so that was weird. We have an old iPad we can use as the monitor so that works out well, and I like that if we go out we could check on the baby remotely. But I'd be wary of relying on this as the sole baby monitor because I often wake to find the app has shut down even though the iPad is plugged in (I guess more a criticism of a bug in the app, but it's a whole package). For us it's not such a big deal because we live in an apartment and I can hear the baby cry without a monitor, but for others it could be a major problem. The night vision works great.

NOW WITH THE LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE, IT NO LONGERS RECORDS OR UPLOADS VIDEO!!!    I HAVE NEVER FELT SO SCREWED BY A COMPANY!    Update:    Here is the email that I sent to Samsung Customer service. I will let you know if I receive a reply:    \\""I bought two separate Double Packs of the SNH-1011N Smart Cam, four cameras total to use to monitor a rental property.    I bought these cameras because it said on THE BOX:    \\""Recorded events  Never miss a moment with  sound & motion activated  footage that automatically  uploads a 30 sec. video clip to  your private YouTube account\\""    I spent several hours reconfiguring for new firmware update for the cameras on my property.

Yes, I enabled everything using both the web app and android app. I requested the authorizations on every level and every page, for every camera, for the videos to upload to my google drive, and it still does not work.

Abdul Jaleel,4,I just ordered a second one,2014-08-30,Y,"I got this camera to be able to check in on my senior cat when I was on vacation.  I wanted more assurance than the once a day visit of the pet sitter.    I had a more sophisticated camera for another purpose that I basically gave up on.  I was very happy with how easy this camera was to set up for the basic functions.  I didn't bother with gmail and youtube. I've been testing this camera from work and its being doing great. The image isn't that fabulous, but for its intended use, it's fine.    There were two short power outages and the camera didn't need to be reset up. (You would think it would need to)    I put the camera in the area the cat likes to hang out. It is official,  cats sleep a lot.  Also, an old sleeping cat looks a lot like a dead cat on a live image.  That's where the audio capability  comes in handy.  He will respond to my voice.    I ordered a second camera to set up in the other area he likes.",5,4,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4
somesh,5,In the eye of the beholder,2014-08-30,Y,"I have three of these cameras in use at home - set up is very easy (though you will probably want to go online to get the pdf for instructions if you have any issues), and aside from brief moments when camera goes offline - a wifi wrinkle or server drop, i'm not sure which - checking on home is easy.  I have done it while in a driving car, while traveling abroad.  I even use the cameras to communicate with people at home.  Motion detection works well - sends a prompt alert.  I will say that I haven't tried to save timed video. Device itself is small and relatively unobtrusive.",3,2,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,4

aziz,3,Good picture and not too difficult to install Wi-Fi on ...,2014-08-27,Y,Good picture and not too difficult to install Wi-Fi on my PC. Very unreliable for a security system. Operation depends on the Samsung server for continuous operation. Also very sensitive (too much) to the audio event cycle and not sensitive to the motion events. Large items like a moving vehicle no problem but it will not pick up an animal or human unless they are a few feet from the camera no matter where you place the event control (1 to 5). Very good buy for a great surveillance camera but not data storage.  Tech support is very good.,0,0,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,5

Shaikhani Aquib wasim,1,"This product would be 5 stars, if it worked as intended half the time.",2014-07-12,Y,"This product would be 5 stars, if it worked as intended half the time. I have owned the product since February 2014, and I have to admit it was awesome at first. Setup is pretty easy, and you can view it on any device that has internet access, from anywhere in the world. You just have to sign in with a username and password, and then you can also set an individual password for the camera. Now for the cons. This does not feed the video directly from the camera to your device through your WiFi. It goes through Samsung's terrible servers. Yes, it is live streaming to a remote server, and then when you sign in to view it, either through samsungsmartcam.com or through the app on your mobile phone or tablet, it is then doing a live streaming download. This means that there can be severe lag, regardless of how fast your internet connection is, depending on their servers. On a good day it will be a few seconds, on a bad day it will be 10 minutes. I kid you not. We use it as a baby monitor, and there have been times where I am looking at the camera, and it literally shows my wife interacting with the baby in the crib, with movement and everything, when they have already been in the living room for the past 5-10 minutes. Wow, really Samsung? Way to go. The other problem with their servers is that they will sometimes have server maintenance or other issues and then guess what? You can't see anything. And then there are log in issues and the fact that you have to update the app or re-download the plugin to make it work in your browser pretty much every week. Also, it eats your battery while viewing the video feed, whether laptop or tablet or phone, really fast. ALSO, it likes to randomly disconnect. Laptops work better but it will still happen. On an iPhone I have seen the app disconnect every 5 minutes and then I have to keep re-logging in. And then add server issues, frequent updates, and lag on top of that and you will be hating it in no time. So like I said, it WOULD be 5 stars. But after using it for about 5 months I have only grown to dislike it more as time goes on because of how unreliable and annoying it is. One last thing. This camera doesn't have an actual button for turning it off. You have to unplug it, and then when you plug it in again it will take 5 min to boot up, which seems rather long for a camera.",2,1,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,2
Amazon Customer,4,"Good Price, Good Performance - Poor Quality Stand",2014-07-11,Y,"VERY easy setup - up and running on my home network and with my iPhone in less than 10 minutes including mounting it!<br />Takes pretty good pics most of the time- i think the latency is on the cell end however, since when I am on the network its nearly flawless.  The voice feature is a  nice touch.  The stand is a bit odd, mine doesn't like to sit up straight all the time, and wants to lean to the right.  I have it hung, but if i set it on something i would be annoyed with the tilted look mine gets now.",0,0,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,3

Ajaya meher,1,Great..when they work.,2014-06-30,N,"I bought mine at Costco a while ago and the main reason was that I had internet monitoring with ho monthly subscription. When these work, I can monitor them from anywhere via the Techwin app. That's the rub. 80% of the time it tells me I have to install the web viewer plug-in even though I have JUST installed it or it had been working just an hour ago. Continuous updates that don't end up fixing anything and a continued bad-habit of cameras being grayed out on the menu & not hooking up. Random, but consistent enough to prove a bad trend. What a shame because like I said, WHEN they work, they're great.",2,1,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,3
V S.,1,Not good any more.. updated to Good for me.,2014-06-21,N,I was using the Smart Cam fine until youtube upload was working. As soon as they switched to Google Drive i am very upset as i am not able to use the camera at all. below are the issues.  1. Camera is not recording any more as the Google Drive is getting full in 1 days  2. Even after deleting all files from google drive and emptying trash Camera is not uploading videos to google drive.  3. It is almost impossible to maintain and manage Google Drive as there is no option for Auto delete older files and clear the trash.  4. it would be nice if samsung provides interface to have the files deleted permanently in google drive  from the camera setup.  5. I did tried to automate the delete process from my mac Automator but no luck in emptying the trash of google drive .  now  the camera is of no help for me. it would be just a useless camera if you want to record the events.   Update : I got a fix for deleting files automatic using google scripts. please check below link for the script. thought it would be helpful for someone. I would still keep it 1 star coz of all the trouble i have gone through.  http://chaguri.blogspot.com/2015/04/google-scripts-for-smartcam.html,14,10,Samsung SNH-1011 Wireless IP Camera,5

Marati.Balachandar,5,Pleasantly surprised,2015-08-22,Y,"Since this camera was refurbished, I figured it would be dented or scratched, or scuffed in some way. I arrived just like new. It had all the things a brand new camera was supposed to have in the box. After I charged it up, I registered it online, and downloaded the Owners Manual - and there was a firmware update for the camera.<br />I downloaded it directly into the camera with the cable connected to my laptop. Then I started to play around with the camera itself. The flash worked fine. The video function worked fine. I took it all over outside and took random photos. The screen was crisp and clear.<br />I quickly learned what most of all the buttons were for by the second day, and the &#34;viewfinder&#34; on the big screen was different then my old camera. So once I got the hang of it - smooth sailing.<br />In this case, refurbished doesn't mean &#34;junk&#34;. I've pleased with my purchase, and can honestly recommend this camera to anyone else - as a beginner or intermediate picture taker.",1,1,"Samsung WB1100F 16.2MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 35x Optical Zoom, 3.0"" LCD and 1080p HD Video",3

An Amazing Purchase.,2015-08-17,Y,"Samsung WB1100F 16.2MP CCD Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 35x Optical Zoom, 3.0&#34; LCD and 720p HD Video (Red) (Certified Refurbished) (New)<br />I came across this camera when I decided to look in Amazon Warehouse for a camera.  The camera works perfectly and has more bells and whistles than I expected.  I feel that the camera is an amazing camera.  The few burps I have encountered I believe are due to user error since I am still learning how to use all the functions and settings and how the functions should be used and under what conditions-  I've had a problem with a picture, changed the setting and problem solved.  I also don't have unreasonable expectations, this camera gives you many options and settings and there are functions that surprise me every time I find one but it is still a point and shoot camera.  The zoom is amazing.  I have used it a couple of times like binoculars and the pictures were spectacular.  It's a beautiful camera to look at.  I've read of people complaining about shutter speed, I believe that was user error (including not finding out a settings limitations).  Others complained that it didn't come with a manual.  Most electronic companies are now posting the manuals for their products online to save on the cost of printing them.  It's the consumers choice to save the file or print it out themselves.  My camera did not come with a memory card, but I expected that it wouldn't since items with internal memory tend not to come with a memory card.  I read the review and question/answer section on the site and researched on my own to discover and find the memory card that I wanted based on my past experience with taking pictures across devices.  I bought a (SanDisk Ultra) 64GB Micro SDXC based on a question about memory that was answered by another buyer on the site. I also bought an extra battery and a battery charger.  You can charge the battery inside the camera but I don't like having to wait for the battery to charge before I can use my camera.  How fast the battery runs out depends on your settings and how long you charged it for.  I bought a bundle of the battery, battery charger, a 5 piece digital camera and camcorder accessory kit and case on Amazon for a very reasonable price.  The seller I purchased the camera from is &#34;Gotta Buy Now&#34; and I highly recommend them.  If you do a lot of uploads to online sites, use the cloud, email etc.  you would like this camera and it would be incredibly useful to you.  All together this was a very reasonable and inexpensive purchase for the camera and it's accessories.  I definitely got an extremely good deal and it was more than worth it.  I also recommend registering the camera with Samsung and using their site.

Shashi,5,"Good camera, 1st refurb had chronic zoon lense error, replacement unit working great",2015-07-26,Y,"Update: Replacement camera working just fine, incredible pictures and easy to use. Focus on long distance zoom does take some practice and patience, but expected with hand held shots not using tripod. FYI - the first unit came in bubble wrap without original camera box. But did have charger and all cables and small user guide. The replacement one came in original box and again with all accessories. So can expect when ordering might get original box, sometimes not. But camera itself seems good quality.  Original Post: Waiting to see how return/replace goes. Out of the box kept giving the zoom lense error - you can google that. Returning for replacement. Otherwise, the two times it opened ok, worked well for handful of closeup and distance zoom test shots. Looking forward to having one that works!",0,0,"Samsung WB1100F 16.2MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 35x Optical Zoom, 3.0"" LCD and 1080p HD Video",4
Gani Khan,2,I was real happy with this camera when I bought it,2015-07-25,Y,"I was real happy with this camera when I bought it, but it soon developed a problem where it had a yellowish discolor over about 2/3 of the picture, through the lens and then in the actual photos uploaded on the computer or printed. At first I thought I was doing something wrong, but as the problem became more persistent I finally had to give up and send it back to Samsung for repairs.<br /><br />I just got the camera back, but I will be honest, I am not happy that I had to send it in to be fixed - I am careful with my stuff, and I know it was not dropped (and to their credit they never said that it had damage from being dropped). I just don't think a problem should have developed in the first place. Time will tell if the problem is actually fixed. According to the paperwork, they replaced a major part. If that one goes bad, I will be going back to a different brand.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has a very nice zoom and the wifi feature is great.<br /><br />Oh, another negative feature is that if you forget to take the lens cap off, you have to turn the blame thing off instead of just removing the lens cap. That is kind of stupid. It should be able to tell the cap has been removed.",1,0,"Samsung WB1100F 16.2MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 35x Optical Zoom, 3.0"" LCD and 1080p HD Video",3

The camera itself is also slow at taking pictures. The camera has a 35 zoom I believe. The problem with that is once you zoom in, the view becomes blurry.  What's the point of having a zoom if it's going to blur out at a certain point. It doesn't take great night pictures and turns everything white. It also needs more stability.  In fact, I think my Samsung S5 does a better job at taking pictures. I'm taking my camera back. I haven't printed my pictures yet, so I don't know about the quality of the pictures but if they're looking blurry on the camera they will look worse in print.

A plus side is that in the section titled, SMART: Action Freeze, it gives you the option to take unsteady handed pictures.<br />2.- I believe the Photo Editor should have offered a wider range of options in choosing different color changing, and photo enhancing  opportunities.",0,0,"Samsung WB1100F 16.2MP CMOS Smart WiFi & NFC Digital Camera with 35x Optical Zoom, 3.0"" LCD and 1080p HD Video",2

Great utility for low-budget film makers.<br />+ Robust, sturdy handling; get it to outdoors.<br />+ Vivid colors right out of the camera.<br />+ It is a 'poor man's photo studio. Enjoy a Minolta prime lens from '80s for $100; compared to $800 nikon/canon counterpart!<br />+ 50 mbit video output, will satisfy you if you need broadcast level requirements.<br /><br />Cons;<br />- Firmware 2.0 has some problems with focus mode; sometime it locks to a certain mode and you need to reset the camera in order to work it again. I believe next update will fix it.<br />- LCD screen is soooo prone to scratches; I had few scratches after some light usage. You need to have a screen protector.<br />- No audio output; BUT it is no deal-breaker; since you will use an external recording device if you are serious about your video anyway.<br />- I found the video output a bit 'soft' compared to higher-end Canons (5D III), that can be fix at post.<br />- Poor ISO performance, any ISO bigger than 800 is practically unusable for commercial purposes.

Make sure you get a huge memory card.  Also if taking constant bursts you will reach a point where you run out of buffer and it will slow down.  Keep that in mind and shoot in small bursts if possible.  I have just purchased my second lens for this camera.

DRO is fantastic in this camera because when you use this in landscape the picture is like real and when you take portrait inside the house with a very bright backround outside, the camera will automatically brighten the person while the background outside is properly exposed. that is why i always set the iso in auto and the DRO is on, this settings makes my camera automatic, just turn it on and ican take a shot right away. of course the main reason i like sony camera is because of the EVF. the autofocus is very fast. i like the focus limiter for fast moving subject, the lock-on AF for portrait and slow moving subject. and the effortless face detection function for portrait but very effective. one cool thing also is that you can choose or change what functions you want in function menu. about the low light just go to ISO setting choose high-iso NR and choose jpeg and you can get noise free photo up to iso 25000(cool). what i really like about this camera is this is moist and weather sealed and has a magnessium body plus weather sealed lens...WOW!",0,0,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),1

kom,5,Best aps-c camera ever made period!,2015-06-23,N,"I started out my affair with a Sony a230, moved to an a580 which was an awesome camera with good resolution and good high ISO performance. After that I moved to the a77 which the resolution was absolutely amazing but the high ISO was a little less than the a580 bit still useable. I sold the a77 for the a77ii, and so far it's been even better than any of these cameras. The high ISO is comparable to the a580 as far as I'm concerned. The resolution is great and when on a tripod zoomed to 1:1 the detail is amazing. I shoot landscape so details are very important to me. I can clean up high ISO noise very nicely between light room 6 and topaz denoise so for me this is a perfect camera. Great resolution, great ISO performance. Now to the real selling point for me the auto focus. WOW...WOW...WOW blazing fast. Now out of the box it's not tuned you have to fiddle with it to get it to your liking. I took an hour out and went through menus and learning the af modes. I use expandable lock on af for moving subjects and manual focus with its amazing peaking mode for my landscapes. With the peaking you can zoom in to 2 different different settings to fine tune your results. I get 100% keepers using these 2 methods. And finally the price of this camera. Under $1000 for this powerhouse is insane. The canon 7d mark ii  is around $1200-$1300 and while it's auto focus is close to the a77ii, it is no match for resolution or auto focus. Canon shooters will combat that but fact of the matter this camera is a hell of a powerhouse. I love my a77ii and if they make an a99ii with the same auto focus I'm buying it. The new a7rii is a nice camera but e mount cameras are just too small. Don't question this purchase just do it!

M.sasikala,3,"I love this camera, ""But""...",2015-05-12,N,"Everything about this camera is amazing. I love that they got rid of the GPS feature and added WiFi connectivity, also the focus limiter on this camera is really useful especially if you're shooting sports with a slow focusing lens like the Minolta 70-210mm f4 &#34;beer can&#34; lens (In case you're wondering where this magical focus limiter is it's the button on the bottom right hand corner with a &#34;C&#34; on it and it's also the trash button and you adjust it with the aperture and shutter dials). I also love that the the buffer can handle more then 14 shots in RAW before lagging, I believe I get 28-30 RAW images before the buffer fills up at 8fps, and something like 56 high resolution JPEG images before the buffer fills up. You'll need a SD card that writes/reads fast like 65mbps or faster to get these speeds. I could go on for days on why I love this camera and you're probably wondering why I only gave it 3 stars, here's why. They got rid of the focus assist beam and when I did a shoot in low light with off camera flash it could not focus on my subject &#34;at all&#34;, this would be no problem if you're shooting with a speedlight on camera but I rarely ever shoot with an on camera flash and I don't have strobes/monolights with modeling lights in order to focus plus I like to shoot outdoors on location. In order to overcome this set back I had to point a flashlight at my subject in order to focus. My old a77 would focus in complete darkness which is one of the things I loved about it and I would brag to &#34;Canokion&#34; shooters with their 5d mark iii's, or nikon d800's which couldn't hold a candle to the focusing capabilities of the a77. You may say my review only applies to a select few shooters but to those that do you've been warned. That feature alone shouldn't deter you from buying this amazing camera but I hope it helps in your expectations on how this best/fastest autofocusing camera does in low light in comparison to the original game changer in pro-sumer cameras. I hope that if and when Sony comes out with the a99 ii or its next full frame a-mount camera that they keep the auto focusing assist lamp and not disregard it's significance in this highly competitive market.<br /><br />Edit.<br />With a 40 MB/s card I get 26 Raw images before the buffer fills up and 56 HiRes JPEG images. Now with a 95 MB/s SD Card I get 32 RAW images and 62 HiRes JPEG images. The 40 MB/s is a Sony SD Card and the 95 MB/s is a SanDisk Extreme Pro SD Card, not the most scientific experiment but it gives you an idea of what this camera is capable of for all you Sport Photographers. I added an image from the shoot that I had trouble with.-sumer cameras.

kamal hasan,5,Just a few points to compare it to the a77.,2015-04-16,Y,"Before buying this camera I have only used the original a77 (which unfortunately got stolen after three years of use) so I'd just like to share a few points on the improvements.  - Smart(er) autofocus This thing is smart, smarter than the a77 and smarter than me I think. Face recognition, eye recognition, smile recognition, smart tracking, area tracking etc. etc. I played with it all, but in the end I often keep it &#34;dumb&#34; because it can sometimes be very overwhelming and interfere with changing conditions. It takes a lot of practice and fiddling to get it to work the way you want, but if it works, it works well, though I did miss a few shots because the camera kept &#34;recognizing&#34; the wrong kid once during a band concert. The bigger focusing area with more focusing points really is nice.  - Better sensor I do notice the difference, especially in low light photography. But it's really just barely noticeable.  - Bigger buffer Man do I love the bigger buffer. It is seriously annoying to see a great picture opportunity and after only a few bursts the camera just stops taking pictures. This thing just keeps going, and going, and going.... One thing that I did notice however is that even when taking single pictures, the camera takes a little longer to write to the card and during that time I get a &#34;writing to card&#34; message when I want to review a shot. I can't remember that being much of an annoyance with the a77.  - New mode dial The great thing about the new dial is that the three memory settings are now quickly available through the dial in stead of having to go through the menu. The not so great thing is the lock button in the center. I never had any problems with the original dial moving on me, but now I find myself cringing when forgetting to push the button to move it to a different mode.  - Wifi! Very cool to be able to send pictures to my phone when on the road so I can post them on the interwebs! I can also control the camera from my phone.I still plug my card straight into my computer so I can import the pictures with Lightroom though.  - Better control There are more ways to configure the camera and it is easier to do this through the menu. I had problems setting up back button focusing on the a77, on this one it's a breeze. Every single button can be re-assigned. Settings are better shown on screen and the menu is slightly faster to navigate through.  - Battery life. It sucks. It truly does. Buy a few more batteries.  - Standard hot shoe Hallelujah! I suppose it would suck if you already spend way too much on a Sony flash (which do work wonderfully I must admit) but mine was stolen along with the camera so I'm happy that I can now spend way less on a new flash. (I'm thinking Yongnuo YN-568EX II)  - No GPS I don't think anybody noticed.  - Build-in focus limiter. Absolutely awesome! Every lens that you mound can have it's focus limited if you want to avoid excessive hunting and it is a snap to set it up and reset back to normal.  To summarize, I don't think this camera is worth &#34;upgrading&#34; to from the original a77, but if facing the choice to buy this new one or saving a few hundred bucks to buy the old one I would definitely recommend to spend those bucks and buy the new one. Sony really did a good job at addressing some of the annoyances of the a77. The a77ii really is better.",4,3,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2

MARYAM SHAHUL,5,I gave up on smaller mirrorless cameras for this and couldn't be happier!,2015-03-23,N,"I am a working photographer who gave up using traditional DSLRs and moved to mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras. I found plenty of things that I liked about the micro 4/3 cameras and lenses from Olympus and Panasonic such as quality electronic viewfinders (EVFs) that allow me to preview my exposure, fast single-point AF, and light weight. But at the end of the day I wasn't satisfied with the high ISO noise or the difficulty in getting shallow DOF and creamy bokeh using normal focal length lenses with f/2.8-f/4 apertures at normal working distances.<br /><br />I tried the Sony E-mount and FE-mount cameras. These cameras gave me the image quality I wanted but even in early 2015 the selection of fast-aperture native E and FE mount lenses with autofocus is pretty limited. Next I tried mounting the extremely nice Sony A-mount lenses to the Sony E-mount and FE-mount cameras using the LA-EA4 adapter which provides good AF performance. However, after I started using that setup I realized I was using small cameras with GIANT lenses and I was making too many sacrifices.<br /><br />As great as the Sony A6000 and Sony A7 are when paired with the LA-EA4 adapter, they still don't deliver AF performance that rivals a traditional DSLR in both single-point AF speed and continuous tracking AF. Not only that, but the smaller mirrorless cameras use smaller batteries that run out of power faster (batteries run out too fast for many working photographers or serious enthusiasts).<br /><br />This is where the A77II comes in, this camera delivers the same live view EVF experience as the A6000 and A7 but with MUCH better autofocus (even better with the latest firmware update), massive batteries that last longer, it's weather-sealed, and it natively uses the lenses I want/need. Yes, it's heavier than the A7 or A6000 with LA-EA4 adapter, but it's also MUCH better. If you're like me and you're using the A-mount lenses anyway then you might want to just get the A77II.",10,10,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2

Amazon Customer,5,Amazing for makeup photos/instagram!!,2015-03-05,Y,"I am absolutely in love with this camera!!!  I am a big &#34;instagramer&#34; and I did a ton of research to find the best camera to take pictures of makeup and selfies in general (I know how bad this sounds, but it's part of my job, I work for a skincare/makeup company). This camera is amazing for this purpose because it has a soft flash (level 4 out of 10) so you can use the flash to take a photo of yourself and illuminate your face without it washing you out.

Rajsri Raajarathinam,5,This camera is simply amazing. I have gone through quite a few cameras ...,2015-03-03,Y,"This camera is simply amazing.  I have gone through quite a few cameras trying to find that perfect balance between a point and shoot and my heavy DSLR.  I wanted a point and shoot esque camera that took higher quality photos without being nearly as heavy as my full size DSLR and this camera delivered just that.  The flip up viewer allows you to orient your selfie perfectly and ensure that no one's head is getting cut out (just make sure to look away from the viewer before you click the button!).  The weight is a bit more than a standard point and shoot, and you definitely can't just shove this bad boy in your pocket like may other cameras.  But if quality is more-so what you are looking for, this is a perfect camera to get.  I also love the full 1080p video, it syncs up perfectly with my DSLR video so I don't feel like I need to lug it around on casual outings when I don't want to risk missing some funny videos.<br /><br />10/10 would re purchase.",5,4,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2

Manjusha,5,No other camera in this price range comes close.,2015-01-31,N,"Let me start off by saying I've been a photography/camera enthusiast since the mid 60's. I bought my first digital camera in 2003 and my first DSLR, a Sony A100 in 2007. Since then I upgraded to an A55, A65 and A77. While these were all good cameras they all seemed just a little lacking in some way. Last July I bought an A77ii and finally I've found the camera I'm totally satisfied with. I waited almost 8 months to write this review because I wanted to make sure I knew all there was about this camera. Well this time Sony got it right and at a reasonable price. No other camera in this price range can match this camera in my opinion.<br /><br />Auto focus; Sony made a lot of changes to the autofocus capability. Now I won't claim that the camera matches dedicated sports cameras that cost thousands of dollars more but I find it certainly gets the job done for action. I shoot a lot of sports and the camera has several AF modes that allow you to get a lot more keepers when compared to my previous cameras. One mode allows you to lock on your subject and stay locked on even when someone comes between you and your target. Almost any camera with PDAF will focus fast on stationary subjects. It's locking on and tracking a moving target that separates this camera from previous cameras I've owned. The A77ii is much better in this regard. Here's what Digital Photography Review has to say;<br /><br />\\""The Mark II gains a range of subject identifying technologies that Sony has introduced in recent models. As such, it offers Eye-AF, rather than just face detection. It also gains the most advanced version of 'Lock-On AF' that we've yet seen, which will use or allow you to specify an off-center starting AF point (previously most Sonys assumed your subject was the thing at the center of the frame, when you started tracking).<br /><br />Unlike the A99, which used its on-sensor phase detection elements to track a subject's movement when it was between the focus sensor's focus points, the A77 II uses the focus points adjacent to the currently active point. In addition, the A77 II becomes the first Sony that lets you determine how doggedly the camera should stick with the current focus point - an option you'd usually only expect to find on very high level models. Better still, it lets you specify different values for video and stills shooting.<br /><br />On top of this, the camera has an A99-style distance limiter that lets you specify the approximate range of focus distance over which you expect your subject to travel, to prevent the camera being distracted by near or distant subjects. Also added is an option to prioritise release or focus in continuous shooting, giving much greater control over the camera's continuous focus and shooting behavior. Overall, the A77 II represents a major step forward for Sony autofocus control.\\""<br /><br />The EVF has been improved over the old model and despite the same specs looks more realistic than the old one. It's hard to tell it's not an OVF.<br /><br />One of the biggest criticisms of Sony cameras has been their JPG output, especially at high iso so the most picky pixel peepers have resorted to RAW. The JPG engine has been improved enough where I use iso 6400 without a problem whereas I previously stopped at iso 3200. Low iso IQ has also been improved with much less smearing in areas where the scene was slightly out of focus (when viewed at 100%). This was a common complaint about previous Sony cameras also among the pixel peepers.<br /><br />The A77ii has the new Bionz X processor which speeds op the camera significantly. This has been coupled with a much deeper buffer, a big shortcoming of the older cameras. When using 12fps mode the camera seems to go on for ever until it slows down. When it does you let up on the shutter and the camera then flushes the buffer you are ready to go so fast that you will not miss your next shot. There is also no interruption or blackout of the EVF while this happens. Be aware that I am using the fastest SD card available so it's entirely possible a lesser card may slow the process down.<br /><br />Ergonomically the camera has some major improvements. Almost every button can be customized as well as the Fn menu. This is a huge improvement for us \\""power\\"" users. Even the old and useless ? button can now be used for something. I have it set to bring up the auto focus range limiter, another new and extremely useful feature. There are now 3 memory recall locations on the mode wheel instead of the one on the A77. Gone are the for me useless scene, Auto+ and 3D modes. Those belong on a P&S, not a semi Pro camera like this.<br /><br />The camera now allows tethering to a computer which is valuable in a studio environment.<br /><br />You might ask is there anything that are negatives about this camera. Yes there are but they are not very important to me but since they might be to someone else I'll mention them.<br /><br />GPS is gone and has been replaced by WiFi capability.<br /><br />The IR assist light is gone which was useful if you want to AF in dark environments. You must now pop the flash and rely on that but this is no solution for flashless photography. This is partially offset by the fact the camera will AF in less light than it's predecessor.<br /><br />One feature I don't like is there is a button that must be pushed when you turn the mode dial. This is presumably to prevent accidental turning but I find it useless since it is something that has never happened to me with any camera I've ever owned.<br /><br />I had to buy an adapter to use my old flash. Not much of a problem as it was cheap and works well.<br /><br />I wish that the shutter button would start and stop video rather than having to push the inconveniently (for me) positioned video button.<br /><br />All in all this might be the best overall multi-use camera Sony has ever made and at $1000 it's a great deal.irely possible a lesser card may slow the process down.

This really is the &#34;King&#34; of small frame DSLR.  If you want to do professional portrait work, you should buy a good (probably Nikon or Canon) full frame camera.

If you take a few dozen shots a year and want access to DSLR lens, there are lots of Sony and Canon and Nikon options at your local big box store with medium grade lens included in a bundle for under $1,000.  If, however, you want to do action field photography (sports or wildlife) where you are distant from a moving target, or you want to do videos on a DSLR, this is the camera for you.

darshan,5,tldr: EVF + new Focus system + A-mount = one impressive camera,2014-12-29,N,"Amazing camera with a few design limitations.  Below is my review of the camera body.  The lens I'll review below that.<br /><br />SONY ILCA-77M2 BODY:<br /><br />PRO:<br />-Uses A-mount lenses and accessories, which means a legacy that starts in 1980. Older lenses are plentiful and inexpensive.<br />-Extremely high resolution APS-C sensor @ 24Mpx. RAWs produced are natively supported by Windows, and in Lightroom 5.<br />-Focus speed and accuracy are truly amazing when used with an F2.8 (or faster) lens. As of Firmware v2.0, this is the fastest focusing camera I have ever used, faster than anything from Canon or Nikon.<br />-Huge buffer for longer burst shots without the dreaded &#34;PLEASE WAIT, WRITING TO CARD&#34; message of yesteryear.<br />-EVF works great in low-light. Much better than OVF. Combined with fast glass, it's almost like having nightvision.<br />-EVF has near zero latency in most lighting conditions.<br />-Records fantastic video (new encoding options were added in firmware v2.0: XAVCS 50mbps)<br />-Rotating screen has multiple uses: protects itself when closed. Opens to be used in a traditional fixed screen manner. Live-view for tricky compositions (macro, astro, long-exposure). Angles completely forward for use as a selfie-cam (if you're into that kind of thing) which is a uniquely Sony feature.<br />-Insanely fast 12fps sustained burst, assuming your memory card is sufficiently quick.<br />-Multi-interface hotshoe (MIS) is based on the ISO hotshoe and is partially compatible with other brands of equipment (Canon, Nikon, etc.)  Can also be used to attach non-flashgun accessories: Microphone array, XLR converter, external viewfinder, video light.<br />-Extremely customizable interface, including user-configured buttons, display modes, and menus.<br />-Top display can be used for virtually all configuration options, little need for the main display. Fond memories of film shooting are possible! :)<br />-Takes SD cards, which are cheap, plentiful, and capacitous. Half the price of similar CF cards.<br />-Produces wonderful JPEGs in camera, including HDR and Panorama modes. (note, RAW mode cannot use HDR or Panorama functions, camera will default to JPEG when those functions are selected. This is by design.)<br /><br />CON:<br />-Too big for those with smaller hands. The average female hand will find this model too large.<br />-EVF works much worse in bright sunlight than OVFs do. You'll need to keep the camera raised to your eye so your eye stays adjusted for the brightness of the EVF rather than the surrounding light.

BABITA BASANT VISHWAKARMA,5,A77II is Nearly Perfect,2014-12-28,N,"I started my photographic journey off with the A100. 6 years later I  jumped up to the A77. By that point I slowly developed a camera addiction. Yet, it stayed in my bag for over two years and never a problem. Now there were a few things I confess I wasn't happy with:  1) Lag in EVF when shooting fast moving objects. Do some BIF's and you know what I mean. 2) JPEG's not all that great. 3) Noise at anything above 800.  I sold the A77, bought the A900 and started getting into Olympus M43. I nearly bought all of the Olympus prime lenses by about this previous October and sold off the A900. I decided I didn't like it as much as my original A77 due to feature set and AF performance. I decided to rent the A77II in order to assess its advantages over the  A77. Here is what I learned.  1) Camera fixes all the above mentioned issues with A77. No lag in EVF, much improved ISO and dynamic range is now another 1.3 stops greater- it makes a difference. 2) Much more advanced AF. More importantly, you have a series of options you did not have prior. This allows you to limit the input of what information is received by the AF module. This allows for much more responsive and accurate AF tracking in varied scenarios. Best feature hands down. 3) The A77II is the most versatile all around camera I've ever used. Not to small for big lenses, yet not to big you regret carrying it around. The grip isn't quite as recessed as the new Nikon D750, but it offers plenty of real estate on the side for maximum comfort.They didn't mess with this which was a smart move IMO. 4) EVF quality has improved with better contrast. Quick customization of button assignment isn't to bad either.   I now own the A7...I'll probably end up with the A7II or the A9 when that is released. Neither replace the A77II- not yet, not any time soon IMO. This is because it exceeds so well at literally everything. Let me mention lenses as well. I have a few big ones like the Zeiss 135. Slap it on an APSC and you get an affective 205mm reach and the pictures are outstanding with this 24MP sony sensor.    In addition, In two years of using the 16-50mm Sony DT 2.8 it never had a scratch and I definitely abused it. Sony could have made it a G series and jacked the price up a few hundred and yet they didn't. My point is, the A77II with the 16-50 is a powerhouse of performance given the price.  Having tried and owning numerous cameras and systems, I think this is a true hidden gem. In many ways, it's the best Sony camera ALL THINGS CONSIDERED that they currently offer. That's if you consider the whole access to both Sony and Minolta lenses in addition to ergonomics, AF quality and mirror less technology- all rolled into one.   5/6/2015  After about 5 months of owning the A7 I personally feel the A77II is a better camera. At modest ISO I can't tell the difference. I will do a complete overview of the camera since I can compare them more readily.   05/19/2015  I've been using the A77II and have found the AF tracking to be exceptional. This is especially so if you choose flexible spot auto lock. The customization options are straightforward and well worth the cost of an upgrade. I'm using mostly the Sony 50mm 1.4 Zeiss, but I'd love to use an SSMII lens- which is noted to be 4 times faster than SSM. You have to factor in the AF tech. of the lens if you're looking to push the A77II. I don't find SSM lightening fast, but it is snappy. If you already have Sony/Minolta glass I'd suggest this over attempting to adapt it onto an E or FE mount camera. It's much more well suited for the job.  11/18/2015  I re-bought the 16-50mm 2.8 because the price to performance ratio is extremely high. I recently shot a wedding with this and the A7II and what I found was that the files up to 1600 aren't all that different. Yes, the A77II has more noise but if you're shooting RAW you can still squeeze quite a bit out of them in post processing. I don't think I'll be moving back over to FE mount for quite some time. The reason being is because the files out of this camera are just as good as at least the A7II up until 1000 ISO and for the cost it's a no-brainer. That's saying a lot because I really do like the A7II, but alas- money is not endless. I could easily sell some gear and just move over to FE but the pros just don't add up enough. Even if I do move back to full frame- which I will- I'm not sure it will be a Sony product. For the versatility of what you get with a DSLR or SLT- access to just a massive catalogue of lenses, great battery life- fast AF, better ergonomics, dual card slots (a99 at least)...that's what I want and the A7 series is just way over hyped and over priced. The A77II is still IMO the best value and- oddly enough- in some ways the best performing camera Sony has. It would be such a shame if they don't push the product development further. It really is that good.",15,14,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),1

ANEESH N.R,4,Selfie option sucks.,2014-12-26,Y,"I come from the point-n-shoot world and for last two years have used a Canon Elph 330 HS. I decided to upgrade to a more advanced camera when it became evident that except on very few occasions, my Canon takes no better pics than an i-phone. Sucks for the industry..and hence why I decided to upgrade. I chose the A5000 because of its size compared to the higher end models. Also, the selfie option seemed cool.    Overall, I'm impressed with still pictures-actually freaking amazing. For the first day, I took identical shots with my Canon and A5000 and there is no comparison. You can zoom into much more detail and the clarity is amazing. So why the 4 stars. Well, the screen isn't a touch screen. I knew it wouldn't be when I bought it but seems intuitive. In 21st century, its intuitive to have a touch screen. Also, selfie option focuses too much on faces and not on the background. Not cool and makes the selfie option moot especially if your standing in front of something memorable and you want it clear. I'm still playing around the settings so if I can figure out how to balance the focus more between the background and foreground, I'll change this to five stars. In my mind though, the camera is clearly designed and advertised for selfie people and the Bokeh effect should be an option and not a primary setting.    In the last two years, I've taken some amazing pictures with my Canon but that was only after I understood what the camera could do and it's limitations. I'll play around with this camera too as I eventually want to learn the intricacies of photography.    Pros:  -Quick auto-focus  -Amazing still photography  -Tons of settings and options  -Relatively small camera  -Easy menu options  -Decent movie making capabilities    Cons:  -Very bad focus balance on selfies between fore and backgrounds  -No touch screen  -Flash seems too strong",6,3,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4

Amazon Customer,2,Not a DSLR replacement,2014-12-18,N,"I purchased this camera from another retailer based upon the reviews available here or other sources, as well as after checking lots of sample photos.  I was aware of its design limitations (no viewfinder, no dial switches, expensive lenses) and I bought it as a backup for my DSLR.  The camera is almost as expected, performs well in good light conditions, good menus, lots of options in a small package.  Unfortunately it is not doing very well in low light/indoor conditions. It is noisy, with a cheesy/clumpy feel as the camera is adding more contrast. For me this is bad news, I cannot simply call this camera a &#34;low-end mirrorless DSLR-equivalent&#34;. It has an interchangeable lens, and a 20Mp APC sensor but this is where the comparison with a DSLR ends.  Indoor photos w/ flash are ok, just zoom a little bit  - focal length 20mm or more will fix the distortions - and they will look good. Outdoor photos are also ok but don't expect a great DSLR level bokeh for portraits (very shallow dept of field i.e. focused on subject, everything else in the background staying fuzzy).   It may be sharing a sensor with some DSLRs (e.g. my Nikon D90 has also a Sony APC sized 12Mp &#34;only&#34; sensor) but this doesn't really help in low light conditions. It appears be performing even worst than a 1/2.3 sensor-based point and shoot. My cheap Sony Cyber-Shot DSC W570 point and shoot is doing somehow better in such conditions.  The bundled lens has rather small apertures (3.5 is the max f stop) on the 16-50mm stock lens and night sky at 30s long exposure pictures for example will look really bad compared w/ a large DSLR. Although the lens assembly itself is 60mm in diameter, the outer glass lens is just 22mm (like those used for some zoom cameras or high end point end shoot). It is a source of a a heavy distortion since it has a focal length that starts from 16mm. If someone's head is to close to the corners or the upper edge of the frame it will be hideously elongated 20% or more.Auto-focus is another weakness reported frequently by many other users. It is slow and fails to deliver a good focus. You either select spot focus or select semi-manual &#34;DMF&#34; or full manual mode. Hopefully the lens ring can be used for manual focusing.   The panorama mode is slow and fails pretty often if the user is not rotating camera very slowly in a perfect horizontal plane.  The flash default setting is to high, over-saturating the badly composition. Also it is failing to pop-up at the first try, I have to push the button 2..3 times since the restraining hooks are not working properly. The mechanism looks pretty fragile and will certainly not last. Tilting the flash lamp upwards for indirect lighting is working bad, the photos will look bad.  The the resolution of the OLED display is fair but not as efficient as the one of my Nikon D90. The live view is particularly low-resolution and noisy in dark conditions although the taken photos look much better when you review them on the same display. Probably the live view resolution is lowered on purpose, to reduce the load on the processor during photo session.  Video is good but far from stellar and pretty limited in options. Cheaper point and shoot can do today 1080p60 700p100, VGA at 200fps!. Is unexpected that Sony delivers just 1080i60.",61,51,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4

Amazon Customer,5,Excellent Movie Machine.,2014-12-15,Y,"While the A7 series strives for small size and weight, the A77m2 has the same the same sensor and imaging quality of the A7 in a standard size DSLR body. All the independent manual control you need is available. Still image quality is similar to Nikon and Canon models but at a cost fo a few hundred less.<br /><br />If left in the Standard style as it comes from the factory, the stills and videos are excellent. The one exceptional feature I find in the A77 is a style mode called Deep. This mode seems to magically reduce the grain, increase the dynamic range and provide more of the look of film than any other camera in this price range. It surprises me Sony doesn't market this feature, but then, Sony has always been known for great innovation without the marketing to support it. You can tailor the Deep style mode with contrast, sharpness and color saturation to even more closely mimic the film look. It creates rich, lustrous skin tones with a smooth texture that seems to hide skin flaws like a photoshopped image. Edges are elegantly softened without looking out of focus, making this the ultimate wedding cam. It provides the dreamy look of a classic old movie. This one feature alone makes the video stand apart from any other camera I've used to date, including the high end Canons. Sony has done their homework in the filmmaking class and come away with an A+. Many of the newer high end Sony cams have this mode, so if you get a model that does, make sure you try out the Deep mode before you evaluate the A77 against any other similar or higher priced DSLR from Nikon or Canon.<br /><br />The custom Sony grip for the A77 and A77n2 is worth its weight in gold. With two batteries installed, I can simply leave the camera on all day and shoot whenever I need to. If you do turn it off, power-up is only a second or so. The grip makes this look like a 5000 dollar rig. Amateur photographers are quick to get out of your way when they see you with one of these.<br /><br />There are three custom programming setups you can tailor to your liking. I set up one for automatic, one for indoor and one for outdoor, tailoring the white balance, aperture and iso for each of my applications. In these three modes, the setups are maintained for stills and video, so you simply press one button to shoot stills or one to shoot video. No going back and forth from mode to mode. Yes, you can do this in the full auto mode, but the A77 lets you also do it with all your custom settings.<br /><br />There is a preset mode for shooting 12 frames per second. It is simply amazing to shoot full size images this fast.<br /><br />If there is one thing I miss on this camera it's the lack of a headphone jack. And of course at least one XLR mike connector would have been a welcome addition.<br /><br />I do not believe there is another camera in this price range that is more suited for making films. Yes, I know the Lumix shoots 4K, but it doesn't have the sexy, lustrous color and image texture of the A77.<br /><br />Most filmmakers are hooked on the 24P mode, which this camera has, but I prefer shooting the 60P mode and converting to 24P in post. The 60 to 24 pulldown provides even more of a filmic look than shooting 24P while offering greater opportunities for smoother slo-mo in post.hree custom programming setups you can tailor to your liking.

This same battery series is in their other Alpha-series cameras.  Wonderful point-and-shoot ease with a pretty good sensor and interchangeable lenses available all countered with a battery life problem.  Turning off wi-fi didn't help, the battery drains really quickly.  Great camera otherwise.  I saw a chart that compares a full-size (compared to 35mm film, I guess) and this is a bigger sensor than other big name brands and their APS-C sensors.  So far, the programmed settings are good.

Hanging 2 cameras around your neck may seem odd, but if shooting an event, you won't need to change lenses.",11,2,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2
Arindam,5,Still figuring out the best mode under each scenario,2014-11-26,Y,Very handy camera to create high quality pictures. The features are enough for me compared to the more advanced alpha5100.

Swati Gangwar,5,SONY A77 II rocks !!,2014-11-25,N,"I moved to this one after 4 years of owning A550L and must say SONY has come a long way. I didn't have the budget for the A7s and the A99s and have an arsenal of powerful alpha mount lenses and flashes that were being wasted on my old A550L with 14 MP 9 point AF with NO VIDEO :(<br /><br />A77 II surely packs a punch with 24 MP, Live view finder, 70+ focal points, face registration, horizon control, WIFI...phew and a lot more which i am yet to explore !! The camera body has also gone so light as compared to the entry level SONY SLR/Ts of the past.<br /><br />Love the change of having a manual switch to select AF modes. The greatest PRO for me is all alpha mount lenses are compatible with this body. A77 II has two manual dials to control Aperture and Shutter speed separately.<br /><br />1080p Video is stunning. I primarily use my SLT for photography but professional quality video is an added bonus !!",4,4,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2
NIKHIL S,5,Very pleased with the Sony A77 II,2014-11-16,Y,"Very pleased with the Sony A77 II. I started with the A100 several years ago, graduated to the A57 and now the A77 II. All three Sony cameras have performed flawlessly as have the Sony lenses I purchased. My Hasselblad and the old Nikons I shot film with rarely see the light of day anymore as the Sony's are just too damn good.",5,4,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),1
Shesh Pandey,5,Steep Learning Curve but Rewarding,2014-11-15,Y,"After owning the Sony a700 and being more than satisfied with its photo performance for over 5 years, I finally decided to upgrade to a more modern camera with full video capabilities. I plunged headfirst into the a77 M2 after selling my old camera bodies and hoping for the best.<br /><br />After spending some weeks with the a77 M2, I can honestly say I made the right decision. The camera was daunting at first, the plethora of autofocus options, new controls, video settings and a new EVF made using it challenging at first coming from the old a700; but virtually every addition to the camera is not only a joy to use, but necessary.<br /><br />If you're reading this review you probably have spent a lot of time researching the camera already. I would say the only reasonable complaint I have about it is the lack of AF assist lamp that I used to have on my a700 (and was on the first a77). There doesn't seem to be any legitimate reason to remove it, and while the odds of trying to focus in near pitch black are fairly uncommon, it does help a lot in low light situations. You can pop the flash up and it will give you an AF assist burst, but you have to physically lower the flash again before you release the shutter. It's a little annoying but ultimately not a huge deal. This camera is really geared more toward fast-paced outdoor photography, so odds are if you're the kind of photographer this camera is meant for, you won't really notice its gone.<br /><br />The EVF is another thing worth mentioning. Sony has the best EVF's on the market, but I'm still not sold that it's 100% better than an optical viewfinder. I like the EVF for the most part, I'm just not sure what the point is when the 3 inch panel on the back shows exactly the same thing. It makes more sense to me to have the viewfinder be optical to give you a different perspective, since when you put your eye up to the EVF it's just showing you exactly what you just saw on the screen. If you're worried about the EVF being slow or inaccurate--don't be. My only real complaint about the EVF is that, even with the brightness cranked all the way up manually, it feels a little dark if you're outside on a sunny day. It's not actually, it's just that no screen can replicate the brightness of actual sunlight. It can be a little off putting at first putting the camera up to your eye on a sunny day, it's also a little hard to use with sunglasses on because of it.<br /><br />As far as the speed and autofocus goes, this camera is second to none. The 79 AF points are completely ridiculous and awesome. I do a lot of fast paced photography and I'm having a much easier time keeping things in focus than I used to.<br /><br />As for video, I would say it's great but not the best. My main complaint with the video is that you can only operate the camera in Manual mode if you have Manual Focus on as well. If you have ANY kind of autofocus mode selected, the camera forces you to use Program mode for video, which is frustrating. If you're primarily looking for a video camera, the newest a7 cameras might be a better choice.<br /><br />I'm including a couple of photos I took with this camera.",12,10,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2
dolon pal,5,Save some time on your research and get this camera.,2014-11-11,Y,"This camera is absolutely amazing.  It has all the bells and whistles of an excellent DSLR with the picture effects and fun stuff of Sony's point and shoot cameras.  The speed is great, it feels good to hold and takes amazing pictures.  Auto focus is spot on and quiet.  I've had a lot of people ask where we had our pictures taken because they were so good!  Mine came with a kit lens 18-135 which is a nice all around lens.  I think I will add a good macro, some filters and maybe an extra battery soon.  I did a lot of research on the competition and it was between this camera, Pentax K-3 and the Nikon D7100.  Canon also had the 5D, 6D, 50D, 60D and there were some others.  If you have a budget of around $1500 and want an excellent camera, this should be at the top of your list.  If you plan on spending a lot more, there will be other options to consider, but not a huge difference to most people for picture quality.  On the negative side, the battery life is a little less than the competition, local stores have a limited supply of 62mm attachments and supplies and there is no direct power cord.  You have to remove the battery with a supplied charger and charge it separately - maybe that's a good thing to protect the camera?  I also bought a bag separately that was bigger than some of the packages offered.  And if you do buy lenses separately, be careful of where you get them from.  Name brands actually make a big difference in the picture quality - I like the B+W 62mm XS-Pro Kaesemann Circular Polarizer for the filter.  No regrets!!",7,4,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),3
jeniv,5,This is an incredible camera.,2014-11-09,N,"This is an incredible camera and I believe it has the best image quality of any camera for the price.<br />I used to have the Sony NEX 3n and didn't think it would be worth the upgrade, until I saw my friend's a5000 images and compared them to the Nex 3n. The difference was clearly noticeable. It looks like the new sensor and the new Bionz X imaging processor really do make a difference. I have uploaded some photos at 100% crop for you to compare. The only negative point about this camera is the lcd screen which is not all that great. It lacks sharpness and the viewing angles are pretty bad, but then again it is certainly good enough to check for in-focus images.<br />The auto focus speed is commendable for a camera with contrast detection, but about the same as the old NEX 3n.<br />Overall in my opinion sony mirrorless cameras are the best in the market, and the most compelling reason to opt for these instead of the Micro four thirds cameras is the much bigger APC-C sized sensor that especially provide superior low-light performance.<br />Overall I am happy to pay the extra dough to upgrade over the NEX 3n.<br />You are Basically getting the same image quality and core features of an a6000 for half the price.",226,200,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2

Great colors.    Nice 40 over functions - but the programmable soft key from the Nex 3N was removed !

Now the user has to frequently enter the menu to access the functions during a shooting session !    Pity this A5000 has so many functions but so few controls and buttons to access them.  Enthusiasts will find it frustrating having to scroll through 20 pages of in-camera menu to look for a function.

kunal chaudhary,5,Wow - feels like back when when I got my first SLR,2014-09-13,Y,"Because I’m already (heavily) invested in Minolta lenses, Sony was the obvious choice for me when it came time for digital. OK, on to the Sony Alpha 77 mkII -&#62; It feels natural in my hands and is intuitive to operate. This is what I would call a transparent camera; that is to say, operating the camera doesn’t get between me and my photography. The OLED viewfinder does NOT look digital to me. In fact, the viewfinder is as sharp and as clear as an SLR optical viewfinder. One thing about the OLED that hasn’t been brought up is that the viewfinder remains bright and clear even when the room is somewhat dark (within reason, this isn’t night-vision equipment). If I had to choose between an optical viewfinder and the Sony OLED, I’d take the OLED hands down…….. yeah, I’m surprised too. I didn’t expect it to be this good.<br /><br />There are loads of options on this camera (way more than I will ever use) and having 3 user programmable memory positions is the icing on the cake. You can ‘program’ each of the 3 memories to shoot different aspect ratios, HDR, or pretty much anything you want. So when you’re in the field, there’s no need to fiddle about with menus and buttons – just call up one of your programmed memories. I’m assuming that you pre-programmed the memories (easy to do) to coincide with what you were expecting to shoot that day.<br /><br />IMHO, with a quality lens (Minolta “G” series, Zeiss) the 77 mkii is capable of absolutely stunning images. Using my Tokina ATX-Pro ii f2.6 (not a typo) the results have been way above what I expected. Technically film still holds an advantage over digital in terms of resolution and exposure latitude, but my experience with the 77 mkii is that its images are very close (as in; very close) to that of 35mm film. For comparison, I shot some 6x45 and had the negatives professionally scanned and…. I’m selling my medium format kit.<br /><br />COMPLAINTS ?? (none from me)<br />I read some reviews that complained about this camera taking 1 or 2 seconds to turn on – which for some people is apparently too long. Listen, if you’re going to miss that shot because of one second (!  ??) then you should have already had it turned on and up to your eye with your finger on the shutter button. It’s going to take you longer to take the lens cap off and put it in your pocket than it takes for this camera to wake-up.<br /><br />Others complained that the Sony tends to favor higher ISO instead of faster aperture. I have to say that has NOT been my experience. My settings -&#62; “auto ISO with auto exposure” and “auto ISO with program exposure” as light decreases the camera selects to increase aperture to maximum BEFORE increasing the ISO.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I love this little camera. I’m seriously impressed with Sony’s ‘translucent mirror’ design. This camera is fast, easy to use (read the manual, that’s a must) and gives stunning results.

prasanth reddy,4,Charismatic performer but has issues,2014-08-22,N,"I bought this camera, body only, and also bought the 55-300mm lens, which I will review in a separate review.<br /><br />The camera can deliver a lot, but it makes you pay to get it.  Still image performance is an A+ and video performance in simple situations is good, but video options and performance in complex shooting (lighting and focus) environments are C- to D+.<br />Rather than arrange items by all the good points and all the bad points, it is more relevant to list them more or less by category.  In each category there are some goods and some bads.<br /><br />Physical:<br />* Solid build, good grip, nice surface finish.<br />* The top LCD is convenient and not overly large.<br />* The EVF is awesome.  By far the best I've ever used.  Large, clear, high-res.  Crystal clear display of shooting information.<br />* Convenient, quick-access buttons for WB, Burst/Timed shooting, ISO, exposure compensation.<br />* Mode dial position is terrible.  This is a heavy camera, and you need one hand to support the lens if you're using anything other than a very short lens.  Most of the controls are on the right, so the natural thing is to use the left hand under the camera/lens barrel.  But to change the mode dial you have to use the left hand, while to use the other controls you have to use the right hand.  At some point you have to let go of the support for the heavy camera.  The lock button on top of the mode dial makes this even more of a drawback.<br />* Battery runs down very fast.  The first thing I did after charging and installing the battery was to turn on the \\""airplane mode,\\"" to save power.  But by the time I finished setting up the camera and taking about 50 shots, the charge had gone from 100% down to the 80s.  Better buy at least 2 spares and carry at all times.<br />* Nice, compact battery charger.  No cord, plugs directly into wall or extension outlet.  Some people might prefer a cord; for me this is more convenient because it's more compact.<br /><br />Documentation:<br />* You get a small and marginally useful printed manual of basic actions.<br />* The PDF manual from online has a rudimentary TOC which makes it hard to find things.  (The Japanese-language manual does not have this flaw.)  Not convenient.<br />* PDF manual is very poorly organized, so that finding relevant information is frustrating and time-consuming.  Example: \\""Shooting Movies.\\""  They tell you how to push the button.  For anything about how to set manual control in \\""movie\\"" mode, what manual controls are available in \\""movie\\"" mode, what digital zoom is/is not available in \\""movie\\"" mode, etc., you have to discover that there is another section on \\""Shooting Movies\\"" that is not mentioned in the first section.  To find any specific item, you have to wade through the menu because there is no alphabetical list or index of topics covered.<br />* In-camera menu is a nightmare--I've had a dozen other cameras from various other makers, and this is by far the worst.  Poorly laid out and counter-intuitive.  I have seen at least one review where the reviewer sent the camera back mainly for this reason.  Features are great, but not if  they're hidden somewhere in an obstacle course.  Also it seems that some settings that I changed got changed back while I was going through the menu.  Perhaps due to the joystick getting pushed inadvertently?  Who knows?  Had to redo several items.<br />* No simple \\""Format Card\\"" option anywhere on the menu.  You put in a card and get a message asking if you want to perform some obscure operation.  If they are formatting the card, why not just say so?  And why force you to remove and reinsert to get to the format card option?<br /><br />Operation:<br />* Changing items displayed is not easy; other cameras (Panasonic, for those who want an example) make it much easier.<br />* Burst options are 12fps and glacial (sounds like about 3.5fps).  I don't really need 12fps a lot of the time; about 5-7fps would make a lot of sense for the otheroption.  Not well thought out.  So I'll be shooting at 12fps whether I like it or not.<br />* Burst mode (RAW) you can shoot short bursts one after another without waiting.  Nice.<br />* Burst mode: when the buffer is full, there is nothing to let you know when the camera is finished writing to the card.  So if you start another burst, you have no idea how many frames you will be able to get.  Not good.<br />* No logic to button and dial settings: I set burst to \\""Low\\"" in Manual mode, but it is set on \\""Hi\\"" if I turn the Mode Dial to Burst mode (why waste this position on the dial when you have a dedicated button for it?) and there seems to be no way to change it.<br />* Push/lock on Mode dial is a pain in the posterior.<br />* Joystick (instead of 4 different push arrows) on main control button is a pain in the posterior.  It's relatively easy to operate if you're using the VF (thank heavens this is what I normally use) but very easy to make an error if you're holding the camera in any other position.<br />* LCD articulation is really bad.  A Rube Goldberg design.  Why not just do a full articulation (swing out) like everyone else?<br /><br />Images:<br />* You can use Adobe DNG Converter (v.8.5 or later) to convert ARC RAW files into DNG RAW files that can be read and processed by any program.<br />* Very clean images (obviously this will vary according to what lens you use).  Compared to GH3, much less noise under similar conditions--in fact virtually none in daylight at ISO100. This means you can use aggressive sharpening to counteract lens softness (common to long zoom lenses, especially the inexpensive ones).  I took some challenging (for the camera) sunset shots, with very nice results.  The sensor in this camera (which was neck and neck with Nikon 7100 and Pentax K-3) really does the job.<br />* When reviewing pictures in-camera, you can enlarge the view (to check focus and other details).  You then can move to the next image and keep the enlargement (by rotating the other dial).  Many (most?) cameras do not allow this.  Very convenient.<br /><br />Video:<br />Sony claims manual exposure control for video, but this is far from true.  There are a number of restrictions and exceptions that remove true manual control.<br />* You cannot use the shutter button to start video.  This is not convenient, to press the video button you have to get into an awkward position, which means that once you star shooting the camera is going to jiggle when you get back to a normal arm/hand position.  Very poor design.  Lumix cameras allow you to focus and shoot video with shutter button if you desire; this totally avoids jiggling.  One point off for Sony here.<br />* To set video \\""manual\\"" controls, you must enter the menu and set them, then go back out and shoot.  This makes it impossible to make changes on the fly, or in short intervals between shooting ops.  A deal-killer.<br />* Video continuous autofocus is awful.  Prone to sudden bursts of searching, even though nothing in the scene has changed much.  Almost like it's trying to look busy to show you it's on the job.  Lots of blurry streches in the clip.  I would single AF, but I can't (see below).<br />* A (Aperture Priority), S (Shutter Priority) and M (Manual Exposure) are available only when the focus mode is set to \\""MF\\"" (Manual Focus).  This is a deal-killer for me.<br />* In AF video, you are not only restricted to Program Auto, you are restricted to CAF.  The camera ignores the focus dial position.  Another deal-killer.<br />* If you shoot video with Manual control, the camera still insists on controlling the ISO.  This is really dumb.  I want it the way I want it, and they always blow out the whites in high-contrast situations like shooting surfers on a bright day.  Far better to underexpose and bring up the lighting in post.  This is yet another deal-killer.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />--Great still images, low noise (I'm very surprised at the high noise complaint by another reviewer; at ISO 100 in normal light I got zero noise), great resolution, color is very good, good JPEGs, good video codec and processing.<br />--Abysmally poor video controls and video AF ruin the video for complex situations (which the GH3, to name one, handles with ease).<br /><br />This camera is going back.

Amazon Customer,5,"Update 11/4/14 - Way Better than Canon, Best APS-C Camera available as of Nov 2014",2014-08-13,N,"Update 11/5/14 - OK seriously this camera is amazing, you will not be disappointed. After 10,000+ shots, I prefer it to the Canon 5D MIII, sit and ponder that for a second. Don't believe me try it. If you pair this with a good lens Carl Zeiss or Sony G or Sigma Art for example, Seriously for the price this is best camera on the market, add up all the specs and you will see, main thing is you need good lenses, \\""never forget, good glass is essential\\"". I recently shot a wedding in Napa Valley and the speed of the A77ii made it my go to choice, so lightning fast, so many usable images it was just on another level. Now get back to the price point, sure the Canon 1DX is a much better camera than any thing Sony offers but it is 6X the price for almost matching spec other than sensor size. The APS-C cameras of the past had a big noticeable difference in quality compared to full frame but the A77ii runs circles around 95% of full fram cameras including Canon. I like the A99 but I prefer the A77ii, the A99ii may be a different story and I'm guessing Sony is trying to get all the specs of the A77ii into the A99ii but with full frame sensor, that will be a game changer. The APS-C cameras are getting so good it is hard to justify anything more unless you are really a pro photographer not just pretending to be. I print up to 40x60 with the A77ii and it looks graet, are you going to print larger than that? If so go buy the 1DX and stop reading reviews. ----------------  It really is an amazing camera! you just cant beat it or even come close for the price. The only mistake I made was not ordering with the \\""kit lens\\"" which is not your average kit lens. I ended up ordering it later because it is so great... I've been using the 18-250mm f3.5-6.3 which is a great lens but isn't quite as clear as the 16-50mm f2.8. But back to the camera, I am a semi pro photographer, I have a day job but I do get paid to take pictures, I chose this over the A99 full frame 1 for the price but 2 it has many more features, faster and it has plenty of clarity / resolution. In my opinion this is the best camera you can buy for under $3,000 and at $1,000 approx for body it is a steal!! the video and stills are great. I will upload a few photos from an event I just shot in Napa after getting the camera. on a quick side note, the in camera setting are actually really cool and produce great results, example the Watercolor/Illustration is really cool, the selective color black & white photos look great and the in camera HDR is the best Ive ever seen but still not going to compare to bracketing 3 shot and post creation..many more features, faster and it has plenty of clarity / resolution.

priyamvada,5,Big big upgrade over the Alpha 100,2014-08-13,Y,I have owned a Sony Alpha 100 for 6 years. It was time to upgrade. One of the considerations for purchasing A77II was the over $2000 in lenses I had for the Alpha 100 that also fit the A77II. The lenses work great The A77II is more than an upgrade - it is a WOW grade for an amateur photographer like myself.,12,10,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4

Amazon Customer,5,Back In Front As The Best Prosumer APS-C Camera?,2014-08-07,Y,"The A77II is a solid upgrade to its predecessor (which was no slouch) with a number of solid functional improvements from the previous generation Alpha 77/65 models.  These include a better sensor, a deeper operating system, a much better AF system, a better JPEG engine from a better central processor, and several other tweaks.I wouldn’t be surprised if the excellent Toshiba sensor in the (now replaced) Nikon 7100/5300 was their design target.  This means that the A77ii is now only ~ 0.7-1.5 f-stops below the Sony full frame 24 megapixel sensor (in the Sony A99 and Nikon 600/610), instead of its previous ~ 2+ stop disadvantage (the 610 being almost a full stop less noisy than the A99 presumably due to the effects of putting PD on chip as well as the SLT mirror).  The A77II is perhaps just under 3 stops below the phenomenal Sony A7S.  While that sounds like a lot, read on to see why this number can be misleading if taken too literally (and is also effectively reduced by several technologies in the A77II).  The short form of a long story on noise (discussed in detail below and in the comments sections) is that DxO numbers on noise (treated as canonical by many) aren’t the last word, and are only one (albeit valuable) metric on this important issue.  Additionally, the noise from this sensor has much less of the wormy chroma component, and more luminence, makng it visually less toxic.  So while DxO suggests perhaps only a third of a stop better, the real bump is more like a full stop in terms of visual image quality. Is it as good as the NX1 and Nikon 7200.  No but it's way better than its predecessor, and the DxO numbers shouldn't really been seen as reflecting how much better. Where I used to cringe shooting over 800-1600 on the older gen sensor, I feel pretty comfortable going to 6400 if I am shooting RAW and doing post processing (using DxO Optics Pro 10.4 which has a great NR algorithm). So, while it's no low light phenom, it's decent, and a lot better than the older gen because of the real reduction in chroma noise.",176,170,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4
Customer,5,"A fast and nice camera, upgrade from Sony a57",2014-08-06,N,"*updated on 8/10/2014 according to Ian's comments about the IR remote control.    I upgraded from Sony a57 which I love to use in the past 2 years. Now it's time to upgrade and I grab Sony a77 ii for its fast focusing system since I use it to take pictures of my kids in most case. Otherwise I may get Sony a7 for better image quality and smaller lighter body. I have the Sony a77 ii for about two weeks now and I'm not disappointed.    Pros  1. Fast and accurate focusing system with many options. You get 79 focus points with 15 cross-type covering about 40% of the total image area. The focus is fast and accurate with a good lens (e.g. Sony 16-50mm F2.8 in my hand.). You also have more options such as Lock-On object tracking and eye focus. I like the eye focus function so you can shoot your kids' portrait with sharp eye focus using wide open aperture lens. It's very useful if you are a pixel-peeper.  2. The exposure and color are accurate. It has been significantly improved compare to my Sony a57. Sony a77ii gives a accurate exposure with pleasant color in most case, while Sony a57 struggled with low light, artificial lights and dynamic seneries.  3. When I take picture outdoor with strong sunshine, I use high dynamic range exposure to obtain more detail from dark area. Sony a57 used to give me a lot overexposure on the high light area while Sony a77 ii handles it very well.  4. LCD screen is the same size as Sony a57 but it is a 1.23m dot White Magic LCD screen, another nice improvement. You also have more options to pose the LCD with fully articulated design. Now you can take a self portrait with the LCD facing you.  5. The viewfinder is the same as Sony a77 and it's better than Sony a57.  6. The Wifi and NFC connection is a good plus.  7. Customer defined auto ISO. It's a welcome feature though I thought it should come with every single digital camera in 21st century.    Cons  1. The remote control app is very disappointing. It only allow you to pressure the button without any tiny control! It's much worse than a simple IR control. Sony released the remote app has more control options for Sony a7/a7R. I do not understand why Sony release such a crappy app for the latest Sony a77 ii.  2. The NFC connection with my note II is a joke. the connect will last no more than 2 seconds, while luckily the wifi connection is OK.  3. The hot shoe is been replaced by Sony multi-interface shoe, which comes with much more functions than original hot shoe. However, I do not know why Sony could not design the adapter that is compatible with old hot shoe flashes. Now you have to buy another adapter to use the old flash. OK. I have t o accept it but when I went through the reviews of the adapter online and it sounds a  crappy product with poor design and quality. At the end I decide to buy Sony F43M to fit it. Another $300-$400 invest. Congratulation! Sony  4. I hope the image quality could be better but it's only a little better than my Sony a57.  5. Updated (Thanks for Ian's comment.): You can turn on the IR remote control in Menu. Goto the last tab \\""ToolBox\\"" in menu and move to \\""3\\"", there is \\""Remote Ctrl\\"" and turn it on. Now the IR remote works. However I prefer to keep the original design putting the IR option in shoot mode so you can access it easily without annoying menu operation. I also hope Sony set the IR remote to \\""on\\"" as default.  (old comments: There is no IR remote control and it's really annoying when you need to take group pictures. I really do not understand why Sony took away this function. I know that you can use your cell phone but the IR remote control is so straight forward and just make it simple. Yes, someone may think handle a big cell phone and click the screen to get a picture is cool, but it's not practical everywhere. In some cases it looks silly.)  6. No GPS. I did not use this function, but it would be good to have it and you have the option to turn it on/off.    Overall I like this camera and love to use it. It's hard to find another competitive camera in its price range. I got the body only for about $1000 after discount. However, I expect more from a $1000 camera than my two more years old Sony a57, which is about $300 in market now. If you are a beginner and your budget is limit I would recommend you look for Sony a6000, which is smaller, lighter without compromise of speed and image quality. I prefer to give Sony a77 II a 4.5 stars but there is no such a option. Four stars is definitely low so I give a 5 stars.  I'll update my review if I find new things.",12,9,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4
Prakash Patel,5,A Truly Exceptional Camera,2014-08-01,Y,"I'm going to keep this review short because, if you're seriously looking at buying an $1,800 camera, you already have a pretty good idea of what you want and are probably just reading reviews for moral support before you hit the &#34;purchase&#34; button!  That said, I am extremely happy with the performance of my new A77ii.  I have had the camera for almost a month and have shot several sessions with it including senior portraits, graduations, and a family event.  The results have been exceptional and the camera is a joy to shoot with.  Pros include, nearly instant (and accurate) auto-focus, seemingly endless buffer capacity, exceptional image quality, and vastly improved high ISO performance.  All I can say about the EVF is WOW!  It is brilliant and silky smooth!  Battery life has been surprisingly good.  My first battery charge lasted for 1,300 shots and I was down to about 30% capacity.  I honestly have no complaints so far, simply a fantastic camera IMHO.",67,63,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),4
Amazon Customer,4,I had great results on better than 90% of the photos shot ...,2014-07-23,N,I have had this camera for six weeks now and have shot about 800 photos. Used the 12 frames per second mode to shoot a local rodeo. I had great results on better than 90% of the photos shot in this mode. As evening approached I had to switch to single shot photos. The camera started to have issues in the fast frame mode in low light. It is still better than I expected. At an ISO of about 2000 with a 70-200 f2.8 Tamron zoom lens I still had good pictures with fast action shots in the bull riding event. My other cameras are the a65 and a55. The a77m2 seems to be a significant step up from the a65 and a huge step up from the a55. Only problem I have is lack of compatibility of raw files with iPhoto. That has turned up to be a frustrating experience. I had to get an Adobe program to convert raw to jpegs.,16,13,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),1
Amazon Customer,5,Great camera for the price.,2014-07-22,N,"Updated 08/28/14:    After a trip with the camera, I am satisfied with the battery life the camera offered. I have stated before that if it be able to shoot 400 shots and I be happy. I have shot over 600 shots and it still ticking. My finding is that the Sony's OEM battery lasts a little longer than the off brand battery. The start up time remain a bit slower than ideal, I did miss a couple shots because of it but overall it is not a big bother to me. The fast burst rate and the quick AF did not disappoint and the buffer is able to let me shoot continuously without delay, the buffer size is the main reason I chose this camera over the Nikon D7100. Overall, I am very happy with it and I am changing the 4 stars rating to 5 stars.             I have a Nikon D300s and Sony A57 prior to ordering the A77ii. Compared to the two very responsive cameras, the A77ii's start up time is slower, it takes a second or so to \\""wake up\\"", it is a bit like booting up a computer. having said that it is not terrible but for some people it might mean missing shots.    AF performance is better than both and I have gotten shots that I thought was impossible to focus. Low light AF performance is hindered a bit without the built in AF assist light, the flash now is doing that job and can be annoying to your subject.    High ISO performance seemed to be pretty good. ISO 3200 seemed to be quite usable; It seemed to have the tendency to over expose a bit (not objectionable) in low light in compared to A57 which will under expose a bit in the same situation. It might affect the expected performance. Hence it will require a higher ISO or longer exposure in the same light. It might have an affect on the noise performance as well.    In lower ISO the pictures quality is very pleasing, very sharp (even I am using 16-105, not the sharpest lens), great color rendition.    The built quality is not as good as expected. The body itself seemed solid enough, it is both the SD card slot and the battery compartment doors that are a bit flimsy, they are not better than those on A57. Body has good heft and the grip is comfortable.    The EVF is fantastic, it is almost like regular optical viewfinder in good light and it almost has night vision when dark. if you want to know more about the characteristic about EVF, please read the A77 most popular review, it was a very well written review. The movable LCD screen also important to me, especially handy for shooting young kids at low angle.    If you plan to use flash, the camera has the new flash shoe, you will need to get an adapter. My old flash have pooped out so I can't report how the flash work until my new flash arrive. My NIkon flash will fit to the shoe but cannot insert completely and will not be able to fire at all.    One BIG problem is the high drainage rate of battery. The spec stated it actually use more power than the A77, which can take less than half of the photos on one battery compare to cameras like Nikon D7100. Upon received the camera, I put in the (Wasabi brand) battery of the A57 into the A77, in minutes the camera showed 'battery exhausted' on LCD screen and quit working. Then I put the OEM A57 battery in it and it lasted a bit longer but the rate it uses power still a bit alarming. I ordered 4 extra batteries along with the camera and couple of them after fully charged, is not fully charged according to the A77ii's battery gauge. Compare to the Sony A57, which also have a short battery life rating, I have shot a outdoor wedding in the late afternoon, with one battery shot over 600 shots and still have half the energy left. All that happened within three hours though. While I didn't expect the A77ii to repeat what the A57 did,  if it could take 400 shots per battery, I would be happy and I am not sure I am getting that number. I am hoping that as the camera is being used, the battery life would improve to a more reasonable rate. Short battery life would encourage the user to turn off the camera when not in use and turn it back on when shooting, the slower start time (stated in the beginning) would be more apparent.  I am planning a trip and I will bring 7 batteries and two chargers with me;  a dead camera is as useful as a brick. This problem did shook my confident toward the camera. Perhaps a battery grip would help but for light traveling, the extra weigh is not welcome for me.    It is a great camera if you can live with the short battery life.",13,9,Sony Alpha a5000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm OSS Lens (White),2

You can not use it in low light without the flash and when it fires to focus several times it blinds the person whose picture you are taking. Who ever thought of this should lose his job.

Don't get me wrong, it takes brilliant pictures and has great quality, but it lacks some features considering it's price range.

No mic input or headphone output<br />3. No 1080 x 60p video.<br />4. No hotshoe<br />5. PRICE!!!!<br /><br />The above factors wouldn't be much of a problem if this camera was priced around say $300-$350, but it's not worth buying in my opinion. You're better off buying last years Sony NEX-6 which is almost the same price (due to it's big price drop recently), but gives you way more and is in fact a better camera! The NEX-6 has a high resolution Electronic Viewfinder, allows 60p video, has  both a pop up flash which bends backwards so you can bounce it off a ceiling and a standard hotshoe, and it's price is about the same!<br /><br />The only advantage this camera has is the flip up screen which allows one to shoot video or take pictures of themselves.

Before start looking for a much better quality lens, try the kit lens and see if it is worth spending more on a lens that would rarely use. Having said that, I might invest in some prime lenses to bring out the best capabilities of this camera.",4,3,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,1

Preet,5,Perfect Replacement for a Heavy Full Frame DSLR,2015-08-24,Y,"I bought the Sony a6000 with the kit lens for a trip to Canada recently. I wanted a light, easy to carry camera with the APS sensor and 24 megapixels. Over the course of the two week trip I took just under 1000 photos, mostly in the Raw format, some in jpeg. The camera and lens performed extremely well with no issues under all light conditions. I was able to put the camera with lens attached into my waist pack with no problem. I used a wrist strap to make sure I didn't drop the camera or have somebody try to grab it. This was a vast improvement over my digital SLRs with their heavy bodies and lenses. I am tired of carrying the big equipment around my neck especially when you get equal or better quality with these mirrorless cameras like the a6000. After reviewing my shots in Lightroom, I am very pleased with the results, even indoor shots at 3200 ISO. There is some noise but Lightroom takes care of that with no problem. I suppose you might get a better indoor shot with less noise with a full frame DSLR like the D5 Mark III, but it's not worth the price and the inconvenience compared to the a6000. Battery life was excellent and the camera focuses very fast. I can see using the a6000 for most of my future shooting, probably with some Zeiss lenses.",4,3,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2
Reeta b.,5,Come down from the fence. To the mirrorless side,2015-08-23,Y,"If you were still on the fence about moving from your DSLR to a mirrorless, it's time to hop over. This little point and shoot looking camera has the capabilities of some of the best DSLRs on the market but runs you only about a fraction a the cost. I'm loving the 11fps and auto focus is fast AF,  and I don't mean the camera acronym.  It's so amazing how much effort is saved just by bringing this little guy to events than an imposing Mirrorfull camera.  Also,  my girlfriend loves the white.

HARRY CALLAGHAN,5,"A fantastic camera, with great low-light performance",2015-08-21,Y,"I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do.  I have a Canon 5D3 which I have not used since I got the A6000.  The low-light performance is just so much better than I would have expected from an APS-C sensor.  I had the Canon 7D, which has the same sensor size, but the low-light performance of the A6000 blows the 7D out of the water, and is on par with the 5D3.<br /><br />The only knock I have is the Sony lens line up is not that great, coming from Canon. Once Sony fixes that, they will have a killer system.",2,1,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,6

I made the purchase because I like the idea of having a small dslr to carry with me at all times. Once I received it I took a few shots with the camera and was unimpressed. The pictures were soft and lackluster. The menu is much to convoluted for me.Also,I am a Nikon user and right now, I really don't want to take the time to learn another system.Some say that the kit lens does not do the camera justice,and that may be true.However,purchasing another lens would also mean a larger lens and that ,to me, is defeating my original reason for considering the Alpha a6000.

B. M.,5,Best BANG for your BUCK!!,2015-08-15,Y,"AMAZING!!! If your on-the-fence or even considering this camera just buy it!! Do your self a favor and purchase this camera without the kit lens and save up for the Sony/Zeiss 16-70mm instead. Great combo worth the $$. I had the opportunity to play with my in-law's A6000 with the kit lens before purchasing my own. The Zeiss lens is far superior to the kit lens and you won't be disappointed if you go this route.<br /><br />This is an amazing camera that has so many useful functions. Take your photography to the next level, or for you pro's have a camera that takes exceptional photos in a compact body instead of hauling around a huge clunky DSLR :)<br /><br />Be IN LOVE with your camera and get quality photos in a compact package!<br /><br />What could be better:<br />* Battery Life<br />* View finder eye piece (tends to get snagged on things.

Not too heavy but not so light that the lens makes it front-heavy, and although the shutter has a satisfying click it isn't something that you'll be worried about annoying people with in public. The rotating LCD is helpful to avoid neck fatigue taking shots that are low to the ground or high-up on a tripod and the adjustable brightness is powerful enough that I can clearly see it through an underwater case while free-diving in Hawaii on sunny days.<br /><br />Be sure to connect it to a computer and update the software in order to allow full support for phase-detect auto focus (PDAF) on newer lenses (updating isn't necessary if you only use the kit-lens). For those wanting to take advantage of the advertised super-fast focus speed, be aware that PDAF only activates in AF-C (Continuous mode) with Wide or Zone focus area, and only at f11 or wider aperture (f3.5 to f11 on the kit-lens).",3,3,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,5

The size and cost are also amazing considering the performance of this camera. This should be a no brainier for anyone that likes to take pictures and appreciates a great image.

Ashwin Pandya,5,A game changer,2015-06-19,N,"For more than a decade I have been shooting actively with Canon APS-c and full-frame DSLRs.<br />When this little Sony with the excellent APS-c sensor anterchangeable lenses and the possibility to use my Canon EF and EF-S series lenses became available at the quite ridiculous price, I decided to give it a try.  I had been primed by the unbelievable little gem, the RX100 III so I sort of had a hunch how the Sony user interface works.<br />Only that I had absolutely no idea what capabilities were hidden in the a6000.<br /><br />The learning curve has been steep. I got the Kindle how-to book by Gary L. Friedman and with its help I have been able to decipher the near infinite tangle of buttons, menus, dials and switches. Now the little Sony behaves like a Canon DSLR with the important exception of its size and weight.<br />It is much easier to grab along wherever you go than the full-frame DSLR.<br /><br />I got the Zeiss 16-70mm f/4.0 zoom to accompany it. It is a good quality zoom but on the hindsight the kit lens would have been more compact, less expensive and equipped with a power zoom which is a must if you shoot video. Zooming manually a handheld camera while shooting will make your viewers seasick. I also got the 20mm Sony  pancake lens which is nice and compact. With the Sony lenses you can use the special features of the autofocus like 'face recognition' or 'eye focus'.  This changes the way portraits of toddlers turn out totally.<br /><br />To be able to shoot with my Canon EF lenses I got the Metabones adapter which promised to give me autofocus.<br />It sort of does, actually. Also, certain lenses turn the camera off and make it unresponsive until you take the battery out and start all over again.<br />The Metabones version of autofocus is a source of frustration if you are trying to shoot something that moves more rapidly than let's say a tectonic plate or a glacier. You can use the manual focusing aide which I found perfectly amusing. It colors the parts of the picture with maximum contrast, or those that are in focus either yellow or white according to your preferences.<br />It is very satisfying to take pictures with a 100mm f/2.0 Canon EF lens with this little camera.

S.D.,1,"Mine was probably defective, but overall the camera needs re-engineering work.",2015-06-18,N,"I bought this camera as one of my failed attempts to replace my beloved Canon T3i + Sigma 18-250 with something a LOT lighter for traveling.  I simply cannot walk around with 2.5 pounds hanging from my body anymore.  I get a terrible backache.<br /><br />The camera and kit lens took excellent photos (see attached samples - the &#34;bouquet was shot from a distance and cropped, the hibiscus was also shot from several feet away - not a macro shot).  BUT ...<br /><br />1 - While others have commented on poor battery life, there HAD to be something wrong with the one I had!  In ONE hour's time, the camera ate through 20% of the battery capacity.  That is while walking around shooting perhaps 25 still images.  NO VIDEO.  NO rapid imaging.  It is possible that part of the problem was the camera constantly switching between eye level finder and rear display (until I figured out how to turn the rear display off).  I did see that one commenter, an engineer, discovered that the constant wifi is a battery drain with this camera.  MAYBE that is the remedy.  BUT, probably not with the unit I had.  It was likely defective.<br /><br />2 - Also, likely indicative of a defective unit, the area of the camera grip around the battery compartment got quite warm.  True, it was over 90 degrees that day, BUT ...!<br /><br />3 - One of the reasons I bought a SONY was the possibility of using my old SONY/Minolta AF lenses.  In a call with SONY, I learned that the brand name adapter is $200.  BUT, it is 100% mechanical and offers NO electronic connections between camera and lens.  YES, you can use your SONY/Minolta mount lenses with the adapter (BTW, there are many generics available for around $20-30), but all operations will be manual.

The a6000 supports Wi-Fi transfer of photos and videos to SmartPhones, Computers and other Wi-Fi devices. The default setting is Airplane Mode Off which drains the battery even with the camera off because it is always looking for nearby Wi-Fi devices. The solution is to turn Wi-Fi Off by turning Airplane Mode On. Only turn Airplane Mode Off when you want to send photos/videos to another Wi-Fi device. Then turn Airplane Mode On again as soon as you have finished sending. Problem solved.",1670,1584,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3

Bhagyashree,5,Great travel camera,2015-06-01,N,"Overall, this is a great little camera.  It's not perfect but boy is it close at this price point.  I have multiple DSLR cameras and am very comfortable using them and the controls.  This camera can do most of what my DSLR cameras are capable of and at a much smaller weight.  If you are comfortable using M, S, A, P modes on DSLR's - you'll have no problems using this camera.  If you're moving up from a traditional point and shoot and just want auto-mode, no fear you'll be taking great pics in no time as well!  Additionally, it has modes for movies, panoramas, and specific scene scenarios.  The camera comes with built in wi-fi and NFC functionality to move pictures to your phone for easy sharing/posting.  Pros: * Image Quality:  It has an APS-C 24.3 megapixel sensor that has produced great images for me. * Frames per Second:  The FPS on this camera is insanely fast.  If you are shooting sports or a moving object - this is a big plus. * Auto Focusing:  The continuous auto-focus on this camera is one of the best I have ever used.  Very good at tracking moving subjects. * Size:  This camera is compact with the kit lens.  The casual person will think you are shooting a normal point/shoot. * Charging:  You can charge the camera battery via usb cable.  The camera can not be used while charging however.  I have charged the camera while traveling in the car and via portable batteries. * Price:  For an APS-C sensor with great image quality, you can get this camera for a steal. * Shutter Button:  For anyone used to the shutter button placement on a DSLR, this will feel natural.  Sony put the shutter button out in front of the main camera body so your finger more naturally falls to the button. * Tilting LCD screen:  The LCD screen tilts away from the camera body to more easily allow for high/low shots. * Interchangeable Lens: Uses the Sony E-Mount lenses.  I have also adapted lenses from several other manufacturers via readily available adapters.  Allowed me to use my existingCanon glass.  Cons: *Battery:  Battery only supports 250 - 300 shots for me.  To charge the battery out of the camera, you will have to purchase a charger separately.  Camera only comes with cords to charge the battery in camera. *Buttons:  The buttons are small, but the biggest problem for me is the dial that also serves as a direction pad.  I find myself inadvertently engaging the direction pad when intending to dial the wheel a specific direction.  I have large hands and I'm sure it will get better over time, but in the first couple months that has been the biggest usability issue for myself. * Sensitive EVF sensor:  The sensor that detects when the camera is to your eye so it can engage the EVF instead of the LCD seems a little too sensitive for my use.  There have been many times when I'm taking a picture and the camera thinks it needs to move from the LCD to the EVF.  Conclusion:  This camera has been a great addition to my gear bag.  I will mainly use this while traveling and hiking to minimize weight.  This camera packs a great sensor into a small and portable package.  Has been a great walk around camera for me and I expect to get many great family pics from this camera.

Abhilash Mamkuzhiyil,3,Good camera but the kit lens is really mediorce,2015-05-31,Y,I started seeing less people bring the DSLRs and so I wanted a nice small mirror-less camera with interchangeable lenses for many occasions. I got the Nikon J1 + 2 kit lenses which is fine but the image is really noisy with ISO above 400. Then A6000 rose to the top because it has APS-C sensor and got many good reviews. I started with the kit lens because I spent quite some money on the Canon. My hope was one day I can migrate to the Sony but so far it's not the case. I got some good pictures but the sharpness and the color are not what I expected from a $700 camera. I don't have a good lens to judge the camera fairly and I know it's not fair when comparing with the constant F/2.8 lens. The focus is fast but many of them are OOF. I also don't need to go over the pros and cons as you can find from the reviews and they are subjective depending on your priorities. I am not ready to give up my DSLR yet.<br /><br />Update: 12/6/2015<br />I bought an adapter to mount my Canon lens on the Sony body and I got good images using manual focusing. I like the combo A6000+sigma50 f/1.4. I didn't do scientific comparison but I am a bit disappointed about the noise level from the Sony sensor. My Canon 60D and A6000 have the same sensor size but I feel my Canon produces cleaner images. I got the false impression that the A6000 will solve two problems from my DSLR: weights and image noise. Another issue is that the camera drains the battery even I don't use the camera.,11,9,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,6

Amazon Customer,4,Great Camera: Poor Kit Lens,2015-05-29,N,"You’ve just purchased a speeding ticket red V-12 Ferrari F12.  The engine roars like a Serengeti lion marking his territory.  The cockpit screams power and fun.  You drive off on your maiden run with great anticipation.  The first jab at the accelerator produces only tire spin and smoke.  You spin out during your first aggressive corner.  Highway speed is limited to 60 mph due to a steady bump, bump, bump from the tires.  What is going on?<br /><br />You check the car out and find that the tires are retreads produced by the Shenzhen  Recycle Co..  Huh?  What is this garbage doing on a Ferrari F12?<br /><br />The above story is what Sony did with the A6000.  The camera is a technical achievement and can produce wonderful pictures.  But Sony combined it with the 16-55 mm zoom lens (kit lens) that is manufactured in China seemingly by the Shenzhen Recycle Co..  My pictures with this lens are marginal at best.  This lens will frustrate the user who is expecting DSLR quality.  Confounding the issue is that there are reviews on the Web that say this lens is good.  One person on YouTube claims that many have told him that they have taken their best pictures with the Sony kit lens.

I never write reviews but when I am prospecting myself, reviews are everything to me. I read and read until I feel comfortable to make a decision whether to take the plunge or not.<br /><br />For 10 years I have been a fully loyal Canon user. I first used a Canon SLR, then moved to a Rebel, then a 40d and then a 60d. I also had a Canon point and shoot s90. All cameras were great. Each better than the last. I loved my Canon s90 and my DSLRs but I never found myself bringing the 2 at the same time to any event. I always had to choose 1. And of course some places/concerts do not let you in with a DSLR.<br /><br />I was excited to see the mirror less options considering one of my DSLR's mirror mechanism broke. I am sure it is an easy fix but I never got around to it. I found it easier to upgrade instead. Especially since that camera took the old school CF cards (yes long ago!).<br /><br />Once I started the research, I was brought to the a6000 ultimately. The Amazon price was $698. Once I saw the $599 price at Best Buy, I decided to make the switch. My decision was made because I was able to have the DSLR quality and lens flexibility in a point and shoot size. I loved the fact I could combine my 2 favorite cameras into 1.<br /><br />The switch to Sony has not been too difficult. It is a much different layout and user interface but it is easy to learn if you use DSLR camera systems.<br />I love the fact that the auto focus is FAST and the colors that come into the camera are lovely. The sensor seems to pick up extreme detail and I am happy with my decision. I do miss the feeling of a DSLR in hand, but portability to me, is more important.<br /><br />The following is a link to some sample images I took this weekend in Boulder, Colorado.<br />I hope my overall experience helps others with their switch!<br />Good luck everyone!<br /><br />Sample Images have no processing besides slight level changes.<br />http://www.artbyamor.com/sonya6000eir switch!<br />Good luck everyone!<br /><br />Sample Images have no processing besides slight level changes.<br />http://www.artbyamor.com/sonya6000",53,51,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3

Previously we had the Sony a33 SLT and decided we wanted to upgrade to something else. Spent a lot of time looking at some more expensive DSLR's but eventually the allure of having something a little more portable won out. Lens choice is a bit lacking but we are happy with the Sigma 30 mm f/2.8 prime and the Sony 30 mm Macro lens we also ordered at the same time. Since we didn't spend as much on the camera body as we were originally planning we splurged on some extra lenses. Besides the two mentioned we got the Sony 55-210 mm and it came with a 16-55 mm pancake lens. These two were ok but I find I keep the prime on for most occasions. The few times I've used the pancake I've gotten significant vignetting.<br /><br />I've only used the Sony a33 to compare but the photo qualities from this camera seem easily on par with or better than a DSLR in the same price range and it actually seems to have quicker focus.

Reena,4,Great camera hampered by poor lens selection,2015-05-12,N,"First Impressions: Tiny. P&S like. With the collapsible kit lens it acts/feels like my old P&S I had years ago (and is tucked in some junk drawer somewhere). I kept turning off the camera when I was zooming because on said P&S camera the zoom was a lever on the shutter button similar to Sony/Nikon power levers. Took forever to undo this muscle memory! I really like the small size, but I also really hate it. It's awesome for travel and being indiscreet, but lenses any bigger than the kit feel awkward and make the camera very front-heavy.<br /><br />Features: The a6000 has a boat load of features. For starters, 11fps and 30 shot buffer does not hurt. So having this around for that is nice, but the problem now is that if you're shooting sports there's no affordable and good telephoto lenses in E-mount.<br /><br />Ergonomics: The camera is small, really small so this in and of itself takes getting used to if you're coming from a dSLR. Also, there's not many buttons. There needs to be more buttons. There's two (C1,C2) that are customizable and another five that you can change as well, though not sure you'll want to as they are commonly used buttons such as EV comp, drive mode, ISO and AEL. My complaint here is that Sony doesn't have enough direct access to functions (or enough buttons to allow for it) so menu dives are still common, even after setup. The Fn button allows you to set the 12 most common menu items for quicker access, much like My Menu in Nikon.<br /><br />Shooting Ergo: with the kit lens the camera feels P&S-ish, as I mentioned above. However, with an adapted Nikon lens the camera feels like fragile and way off balance. I have my Nikkor 60mm Micro AF-D w/ a cheap adaptor and the lens dwarfs it weight and size wise.<br /><br />LCD Screen: The rear LCD is a tad small but it's as large as it can be for this small camera. The tilt up and down is actually quite handy and kinda wish Nikon would add this to the D7x00 line. The screen is 16:9 ratio but most imagesare 3:2 so... it works better for video.<br /><br />EVF: Probably the biggest deal of this camera (aside from its small size) is the EVF and the functionality that comes with it. Manual focus is now a dream and dead simple to do. Focus peaking and focus zoom make this almost* a worthwhile purchase in themselves. To be honest, I didn't even care about this before I bought the Sony and thought it was all hype. But in practice I'll take the Sony approach to manual focus any day. Also with the EVF is the amount of information you can lay over it, such as live histogram, exposure settings and pretty much anything and everything. The EVF also attempts to give you a WISIWIG view of your image, which seems to work well. The EVF is clear and bright and while half the resolution of the previous NEX 6/7 it's more than adequate and has a fast refresh rate (which the 6/7 apparently did not have).<br /><br />Image Quality: Can't write about a camera and not talk about IQ! However, this is a hard one due to one simple reason: the kit zoom, which is my only native E-mount lens right now, is a mixed bag. I hate the lens. It has a power zoom function that drives me nuts. So, I really hate using it. I've adapted a few Nikkor lenses and use them in full manual mode. These give comparable quality to the Nikon that I usually mount them to but I haven't done a full comparison to really comment. I will say that images straight from the camera have good color, good contrast but error on the side of over saturated. However, I shoot RAW which is another source of complaint: only compressed 12 bit raw files from the a6000. This needs to change, Sony. Give us the option of uncompressed and 14 bit RAW.<br /><br />At the end of the day Sony has a pretty cool camera. I like it's small size and it's feature set and it'll be great for travel and hiking. I dislike the fact that lens selection is limited and some of the only choices are expensive Zeiss lenses. Sony needs to fill more gaps and then I'll be a convert. Until then, I'm certainly not letting go of my Nikon.<br /><br />Sony a6000: 4/5",28,26,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,1
Priyanka,5,Great upgrade from my Nikon superzoom,2015-05-11,Y,"Love it! I was looking to upgrade from a superzoom and I wanted a compact camera for travelling that I could use with interchangeable lenses. I've owned this camera for over a month and I have fallen in love with it. I bought the body only and also purchased a Sony 50mm prime and a zoom. I'm now planning to get the pancake lens as well so I can carry it in my pocket on hikes.

Dr Manoj kr Mandal,5,Excellent Walkaround Camera,2015-05-08,Y,"I started with a Sony Nex-6 and was quite impressed with both it's build quality and image quality.  However, I found a really good deal on Amazon.com for the A6000, so I traded in the Nex 6 for the A6000.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the Nex 6 is great little camera, but the menu system was not that great.  The new, upgraded menu on the A6000, along with the increase in megapixels on the sensor from 16 to 24 have made a big difference in the cameras ease of use for me.<br /><br />What's so neat about the A6000 is that it's got a large APS-C sized 24 mp sensor, along with a high quality electronic viewfinder and built in flash, all in a small body that is ergonomically designed to be easy to hold one handed.  The control layout is easy to use, and the ability to customize many of the buttons has allowed me to setup the camera just the way I want it.<br /><br />My one grip with Sony is that their selection of lenses is not that great, so if you're considering this camera, be sure and check out their lenses to make sure they have what you want.  Of course it's possible to use converters and mount a great many other legacy lenses to the camera, but many of those won't have auto focus ability.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm happy with the 16-70mm Sony Zeiss lens that I got for this camera, and feel that the combo gives me a great small walk around setup.  By the way, the camera I bought actually came with a MUCH smaller 16-50 kit lens, which is very good in it's own right, and for many people will be all they need for many years of great photographs.",3,2,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3

Amazon Customer,5,Good camera! Love It.,2015-04-13,N,"Few years back, I had a Cannon DSLR and it was not very practical at all. The pictures shot in our Scotland vacation were mediocre. Replaced with Sony Hx100v. That is when, I became a big fan of the Sony mirror-less cameras. HX100v beat the picture quality of the DSLR and is still a great travel camera. Sony cameras takes  HD videos and compresses and the file size is much small compared to the Cannon cameras. This was a big plus for me as it is easy to store and handle videos. Recently, I got interested in landscape photography and was looking at a Sony with bigger sensor and that is how I ended up buying this Sony A6000 with the 16-50 kit lens. The kit lens is very good. Took around 50 pictures in automatic mode and all pictures turned out great. Some pictures taken while riding a bike, came out great as well and satisfied with the kit lens' OSS. Love the electronic view finder. It is crisp and very closely simulates the DSLR view finder. Since I came from HX100v, I am pretty familiar with the Sony's user interface. It is actually a good and intuitive interface. Don't know why some reviewers complain about the UI. I viewed these photos on a 4K TV. They were crisp and had great color depth. This Sony a6000 does not a have a built-in GPS. Initially, it was very disappointing. But, I found a workaround. Downloaded a mobile app called Geotag Photos Pro. This app is super cool. Once, the GPS logging is started from a smart phone, this app uploads the coordinates to its server periodically. Later, it will compare the photo timestamp and geo tags all photos in a folder from a PC.",18,18,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2
bhavna sahai,1,The first camera I ever broke. Lasted less than a month...,2015-04-13,Y,"The camera has a lot of admirable qualities but durability is not one of them. The optical viewfinder on my broke while in my cushioned, segmented bag. Have no idea how this happened. Shattered in fact. I was on a trip and had to make due. Pretty much of a bummer. Here's the thing: I know how to take care of my equipment. In 15 years of digital photography this is the first issue I've ever had with breakage. So I'm guessing not me. Seems more like a flaw in the equipment.<br /><br />I called customer support and they told me it was an easy fix that I could take care of on my own and they would send me the part. Believed them. that was dumb on my part. They sent me the eyecup piece. The glass on the optical viewfinder was shattered and they send me an eyecup. Called a gain and they said there was nothing they could do since it broke it wasn't covered by warranty (?!). I already invested $900 in a lens so felt sort of stuck. Great side-note: Went to the local Sony store. According to online there was one left in Los Angeles. Ir was literally closing up shop as I walked in. Apparently all the stores are closing (which makes sense since shopping at them was always such an unpleasant experience mainly due to the horrible people who worked there who knew nothing about the products but wouldn't leave you in peace to shop!) If you are thinking about this or any other sony think twice. Their commitment to customers is nil. I've used sony cameras after switching from Olympus and Nikon non digitals for about 15 years now. This was my last one. I think the thing that really stinks about the situation is my loyalty to sony over 15 years means nothing. And in all fairness they have no idea who is loyal and who isn't when dealing with a support issue.

Swati Dubey,5,What's the opposite of buyers remorse?,2015-04-08,N,"Tons of research, hesitations, suggestions, research, questions, reservations, research, and more hesitations brought me to the Sony a6000. I'll admit 2 important facts right up front. I am NOT a pro, but have always taken great shots with less-than great equipment. Second important fact is that I have only had the a6000 for 3 days.<br />...it's amazing. It's user friendly for people who might not know about/need all the different settings. Because of how the camera operates however, you can't help but learn. If you take a great shot, and want to replicate it in a different setting- the image display will tell you exactly how the shot was comprised- even if it was taken in auto mode. I found this useful for wanting to blur out the background but have the subject nice and crisp. Get an additional battery and charger because it only comes with one, and you have to charge it in the camera. I guess that might be my only &#34;real&#34; complaint- battery life is kinda low BUT! once you see what this bad-boy can do- you'll understand why. I was tired of taking &#34;snap shots&#34; with my old point and shoot, and wanted to start taking real &#34;photographs&#34;. I'm not a pro, like I said above, but I can see myself making a career out of photography, and this little a6000 has officially lit a fire under my tail. The instruction guide that comes with the camera is a good as an eye on your belly- button, but there are tons of useful vids on YouTube to help you learn and discover all the amazing features this camera has. The only reason someone would rate this camera less than 5 stars is because they work for Cannon or Nikon. Once you get the hang of the features, any little gripe you might have is just that, little. I kinda wish mine came with 1970 Chevelle SS, but oh well.<br />My biggest reservation about purchasing this camera was its size. I have huge man-hands, and was afraid I'd just be pushing all the buttons at once. Not at all!!! It's perfect even for monster hands. It's comfortable AND compact.<br />Tons of people complain about the lens that comes with it- but I think that's because they ARE professional photographers and really know the difference more than I do.

VINOD YADAV,4,A6000 rocks.  I rarely use my Nikon DSLR anymore,2015-04-02,Y,"I've been seriously shooting since 08 (my daughter's birth).  I've had a few Nikon DSLRs and a number of quality lenses.  I was skeptical of mirror-less cameras until I had a chance to shoot my friends AR7.  I did some research and decided on the A6000 because I think it delivers the best bang for the buck.  I got mine on black Friday weekend in 2014 for about $500 (body only).  I decided to get the sony 20mm 2.8 pancake lens for a compact walk-around lens, and a sigma 60mm 2.8 for portraits (my favorite lens with AF on this camera).  I also bought a Nikon to E mount adapter so I can use all my nikon glass.<br /><br />My large expensive DSLR body is now collecting dust.  The A6000 takes great shots.  I especially like using my nikon primes in manual focus mode (focus peaking with magnifier make it super easy).  I'm shooting more with this camera because its smaller/lighter (easy to carry around) and I'm enjoying manual focus on older/vintage (dirt cheap) nikkor lens.  Nikkor lens (with ext app control) I use on this camera: 105mm f/2.5 Ai-S, 50mm f1.8, 28mm f1.8 and 70-300mm F4.<br /><br />The sensor is pretty good.  I can get great shots at ISO 3200 in most situations... sometimes at 6400.  The auto focus is amazing... just works.  I consistently get amazing shots equal to or sometimes better than APS-C based DSLRs.  I love the tilt screen, wifi connectivity to my phone and all the button configurability on this camera.

arti thakur,5,A Sony A6000 versus Canon 7D Mark II Story,2015-03-24,N,"Previously, I owned the original Canon 7D.  When it came out in 2009 it was an awesome camera.  Over time I collected several Canon lenses from wide angle to telephoto.  Five years later that original 7D body was getting a bit old technologically.  There were many advancements in focusing that just weren't previously possible.  The new mirrorless body styles showed a lot of promise and potential benefit.  So having sold my 7D body, I purchased a mirrorless Sony A6000 kit with a couple additional lenses.  The Sony A6000 body has an awesome set of features that I had never dreamed of, like focus peaking, and the electronic viewfinder (EVF).  It also has really good low noise image quality.  You can read the specs and watch utube videos yourself to see what it can do.  Anyway, I thought I had found the ultimate camera for an great price. I was about ready to totally switch from Canon, but don't forget I still had a number of Canon lenses.  One of the reasons I bought the Sony A6000 was that I could use my Canon lenses via a Metabones III Canon EF to Sony E-Mount adapter.  I will say that the Metabones adapter worked surprisingly well.  The adapter was certainly workable, but not a perfect solution by any means.  Image sharpness was very good.  However, focusing speed is probably the biggest drawback, but for landscape photos that isn't a problem.  Action photography with auto focus is out of the question.  One has to resort to old school manual pre-focusing. Still, the Sony E-Mount mirrorless body was a super device with Sony lenses.  I have the 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, the 35mm f/1.8 prime lens, & the 70-200mm f/4 telephoto lens.  As a side light, the 70-200mm f/4 lens is really a super lens, tack sharp and very fast to focus.  My 3 lenses were all usable, but this was about all that was available for me.  When I went to look for other lenses to match my Canon collection Sony just didn't have them.  I hadn't realized that I had been spoiled by the large universe ofCanon lenses.  This was a lesson in &#34;A Camera Body Without a Lens is Not a Camera&#34;. 5 months later I purchased a Canon 7D Mark II after a long fight with myself over Sony's lens offerings.  The 7D Mk II is a good camera.  It generally compares well, feature wise, against the Sony A6000.  The main difference is that the Sony is mirrorless, and the Canon is a swinging mirror DSLR.  Because of this difference features vary between the two cameras.  The Canon 7D Mark II is a great camera body with fast focusing and many features that I wanted before.  Some of those features are focus tracking, quieter shutter, and an Auto Exposure Lock (AE Lock) that can stay locked instead of giving up in a few seconds.  However, the biggest drawback is its disappointing sensor.  The sensor is definitely better than the original 7D, but not way better.  I think many folks expected Canon to come out with a 24 megapixel sensor in the Mark II for a little over $2000 list, but it is only 20 megapixels priced at $1800 list price.  This sensor has a little better low light capability with a little less noise in images.  The banding that appeared in images from the original 7D are gone.  Where I shot photos at 800 ISO with the old 7D I might use up to 1600 with the Mark II.  Considering the resulting price, perhaps one gets their money's worth, even with a lack luster sensor.  Check out DxOMark.com's review, and of course dpreview.com. To conclude: The Sony mirrorless E-Mount camera bodies are truly great, but lack the available lenses to be completely useful.  I expect the Sony E-Mount lens universe will expand considerably with time. Canon has made a super camera body with great capability and features in the 7D Mark II.  Sadly, Canon seems to be trying to catch up, but falling short as their 7D Mark II sensor just isn't on par with the rest of the market.  One could only dream that a firmware update would correct this issue.  ;-)  Added Later: Considering an A6000? If an externaladd-on flash is important, check what is available for the Sony.  It can be confusing, there are older model flashes that will not work without an adapter.  Old or new, Sony has a different shoes from the rest of the camera market.  The one for the A6000 is a more conventional hot shoe than the old Minolta iISO design. However, Sony's current model has Sony specific contacts along the front edge for their flashes and accessories.  This hot shoe design is more conventional, and a vast improvement, but still weird.  So, far I have only found one after market flash that will do TTL on the Sony. There may be more as I may not have found them all. The Sony flashes that are available for the A6000 are pricey, but then most matching brand flashes are.  Sony is a big company, but not that big in the camera business that they can dictate what the rest of the world will do.  Their hot shoe designs make them an island all alone in the accessory flash market.  Their hot shoe, on the A6000, is painted which renders even a simple aftermarket flash unreliable at best.  Oh, wouldn't it be nice if Sony would just adopt Canon or Nikon's scheme and end this arrogant self-serving stupidity.",5,5,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2
Amazon Customer,5,An inexpensive Speed Demon,2015-03-23,Y,"For the price, this camera is a steal.  Please understand that a camera body that sells for ~$550 new will not be perfect.  The a6000 however, gets very close.  The sensor is terrific and captures great detail.  I prefer the a6000's color output over any micro four thirds cameras (Olympus, Lumix.)  Higher ISO is handled pretty well for a 24mp APS-C sensor.Now for the REALLY GOOD stuff.  This camera is a speed demon!  Frame burst rates and wicked high, AF in good lighting is very fast, continuous AF barely misses and keeps up with fast action, and this cameras ability to track subjects is far beyond what any camera at this price should be capable of.  Its AF points cover almost the entire frame, and it is capable of tracking subjects throughout the entire frame.  If a subject even goes off frame, most times the camera will re-acquire the subject and continue tracking once they re-enter.  The cameras lowlight focussing is frustrating however.  This I feel is its biggest downfall.  I enjoy using of-camera flash in otherwise dark environments and I fine myself being forced to MF, as AF will not lock on.  Also, in daylight the rear screen is pretty useless.  Fortunately you have a beautiful viewfinder to compose and review shots with.  Just use the viewfinder.  As I said though, a camera at this price point and with its other specs, there will inevitably be a flaw or two.  If you purchase this camera, take your time setting it up.  I spent a few hours fine tuning every setting and programing all my custom buttons and actions.

But if I shoot and some break in between, even sometime I would turned off then on few minutes later, the battery drain quickly.<br />The only thing I don't like is not about the camera itself, but the Sony software to convert the raw images. It's unorganized and cluster. It has too many functions that I think are wasted. It takes too long to convert to jpg compares to Canon software. Also sometime, it shows the raw pictures has red  color flooded all over the pictures, but when converts to jpg, it looks fine. This is hard for me to tell which pictures I want to convert or want to keep.

Amazon Customer,4,Great body... Skip the kit lens,2015-03-03,Y,"Had the camera about a week now and I'm very happy with it.  The autofocus system lives up to the hype - very fast, very accurate, great lock on ability when using native e mount lenses.  Picture detail, color accuracy and dynamic range are all very good - on par with any DSLR save full frame sensors. Focus peaking and focus magnification make using other lenses with adapters a please as well - however, the autofocus system is very slow with adapters.  So if youre thinking about using this camera with your canon or Nikon 70-200 f2.8 for sports shooting, think again.  The focus will be painfully slow and negate the benefits of the system when using such non-native glass.  But doing landscapes and portrait work (where you don't need focus speed)with adapters works great.<br /><br />Sony has packed a lot of features into this body.  There are plenty of customization options as well (I have back button focusing set up, auto facial recognition and eye focus, and one touch focus magnification for example).  And it's significantly less cost, size and weight than comparable DSLRs.<br /><br />The OLED viewfinder is very sharp, easy to see and accurate with no noticeable lag. I've had no problems using it and I prefer it to the rear lcd screen for framing.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I'd get the body without the 16-50 kit lens.  The variable aperture is a pain and the lens is only ok when it comes to sharpness.  You'd be better served getting a fast prime like the sigma 30mm f2.8 (which equates to 45mm on APS-C sized sensors).<br /><br />Finally a Sony gripe:  why no fast zooms?  The fastest e mount or fe mount constant aperture zoom available from any manufacturer is currently f4.0.  That's a huge disadvantage from my perspective. You can use a mount glass with the LAEA adapter from Sony, but this adds significant size and weight and doesn't use the awesome autofocus system of the a6000.  PLEASE Sony, make some fast zooms!<br /><br />Otherwise this is probably the best bang for buck camera on the market - mirror less or otherwise.  Highly recommended.",5,5,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,4

raghuram yadav nunna,4,"Good quality and style, works great with older lenses (minus no image stabilization). Apps are a joke.",2015-02-25,N,"I bought this camera from Amazon.    I use quality legacy glass, which makes this camera great. It doesn't feel very portable with f1.4 glass on it though.    I should have given it 3 stars because the play memories store is always offline and the user experience is so poor it feels like a kick to the shins. An error for the past 12 hours after being forced to reset the device in order to change my Sony account to download apps. The whole process is very finicky. I can't even sign in now. It feels like a slap in the face after it was working (intermittently) previously, but wouldn't let me change accounts without \\""initializing\\"" which the message said would not delete content. Well, all apps were wiped along with everything else. Thanks Sony, do us a favor and stop advertising this garbage if you're not going to deliver.    The reason for the 4 stars:  1. Only 5 free apps in the playmemories store. The selection is almost non-existent, and they overprice apps that do functions that should be included in the camera like time lapse, bracketing and get this, lens correction is not included. These are features even some point and shoots include. I can't really see any point in having an app store when there is nothing to choose from. No options for quality settings when syncing with a smartphone either.  2. No rear lens cap or body cap included. Seriously?  3. If you just go by sharpness numbers, the kit lens is average at best. That said, the build quality and focus speed are great. Comparing it to Canon or Nikons kit offerings make them feel like plastic crap.  Sony's kit really feels like a high quality lens. However, if you want to compare price and performance on Canon's other lenses like the 18-200 compared with Sony, you'd better take an aspirin first.    It's a great camera, but I will trade up to the Sony a7 series with on sensor stabilization as soon as I can. Legacy glass takes great photos with  this camera, but the lack of stabilization means you have to usea high shutter speed for handheld (who would buy a portable camera to carry a tripod?). Also, the crop factor is annoying since most wide angle legacy lenses aren't very good, and buying a turbobooster is expensive and lowers IQ anyway.    Verdict: It's a good option to use old glass until you can afford an a7. Given the fit and finish of this camera compared to an entry level DSLR, the only justification for going with a DSLR is if you need higher quality modern lenses (that are still made out of cheap plastic). the lack of app selection and predatory prices is insulting. If it wasn't for the fact that they advertise the ability to customize the camera through apps and then provide a non-existant selection and terrible user interface, I probably would have given it 5 stars. The only real functional complaint I have with the camera itself is no on body stabilization, but given that it's not a standard mirror-less feature, it's hard to complain. Also, who's the cheap-ass who didn't include a lens or body cap with the camera?",3,2,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2

premmalar,5,Sony a6000 and 50 f1.8 are glorious,2015-02-19,Y,"I have owned this camera for a month. I am one those amateurs who still own Canon camera and lenses and who have shifted to Sony mirrorless standard. My canon Eos 5D MkII still is my main camera, but I am using it less and less since I purchased the a6000. The main reason for the shift  is the quality of pictures I take with the Sony and the fact that I  can still use  my arsenal of Canon and Sigma lenses with the Sony. I own only L lenses as well as the well renowned Sigma 35 f1.4. In order to use them with the a6000 I bought the Viltrox adapter for $100  which allow me to stabilize the Sony camera (however it does not to allow to autofocus easily). The manual focus works very well but not all features of the a6000 are exploited.<br />Therefore  I decided to buy the magnificent Sony 50 f1.8 to match the a6000 with magnificent results. This fantastic lens is a beauty and I recommend it heartily to those owners of the  a6000. The photos captured with this lens are the most detailed I have ever taken in my life, even surpassing those taken with the Sigma 35 1.4. I think the main reason is that the Sony 50 1.6 has image stabilization which the Sigma does not have. The price is 4 times lower.<br />In short buy this camera and a 50mm which surpasses in quality both the 16-50 kit lens (which is very good) as well as the 55-210 which is also very good.<br />My advice for a future a6000 buyer is to get the 50 instead of the small 16-50.",12,11,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3

M.zeba,5,"Tiny marvel of technology, my old Canon 7D feels like a dinosaur compared to this",2015-02-11,Y,"I'm an enthusiast and like many current SONY users I'm a convert: I used various Canon gear since the original Rebel came out. I had thousands of dollars invested in lenses. The first two rebels were great cameras. Then I started to grow disappointed with each next Canon camera. 40D was awful. The 7D was better but still I was not happy and I could not afford a better body such as 5D. Also, I mainly shoot while hiking and I grew tired of hauling the mass of gear. After not shooting for over a year I figured it's time to change something.<br /><br />I also used Canon point and shoot cameras and, again, I was terribly disappointed with the quality and reliability. S95 died with the dreaded &#34;lens error&#34;. S100, also died in less than two years. So I started reading and discovered the SONY RX100II. It blew me away! In decent light I could not tell the difference between the RX100II and Canon 7D shots! So I started digging deeper since I never considered SONY cameras before and it came to a very hard choice between the a6000 and the A7.<br /><br />After studying very RAW file I could find on the internet for weeks I decided the slight difference in image quality was not worth 3x the price of the A7 for me.<br /><br />I bough the a6000 with the E PZ 18-105mm F4 G OSS. After the first shoot my jaw dropped. I could not believe it! This tiny $550 body and an $800 lens totally blew away the Canon 7D that costs three times as much. Anything from sharpness and color to speed of focus just wipes the floor with the 7D!<br /><br />So I sold all my Canon gear and bough another a6000 body and the FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS lens. I also bought the Rokinon 12mm F2.0 NCS CS lens and two sets of Vivitar chargers and batteries and AGFA filters. Both bodies, three lenses, 6 batteries, filters, etc fit in a small personal carry-on bag along with Macbook Air, iPad and lots of smaller items! I can carry both bodies on my shoulder and they're lighter and less bulky than one 7D with a tele lens! Sure these are some compromises as I don't have 400mm zoom or 2.8 speed but the kit produces stunning images that I am totally happy with at a fraction of the bulk. My entire photo gear in a small handbag!!!<br /><br />Just like the RX100II, the a6000 is an amazing marvel of modern technology that puts Nikon and Canon to shame. My hat's off to SONY for this achievement. I won't dive into specs. But yes, what people say about the quality, speed and features of this camera is all true. This is not hype. I didn't believe at first. This thing reinvigorated my interest in photography to the point that I took short vacation to go shooting in Death Valley.<br /><br />I can't find really anything wrong with this thing. Sure, it's not perfect, there are little annoyances such as the infamous video button but this is all overshadowed by the technological brilliance and stunning image quality that rivals midrange DSLRs.<br /><br />Speaking of video: with the G lenses this camera is a blast to use for video and produces gorgeous full HD at 60fps. I'm just not much into video.<br /><br />One significant drawback of the incredible set of features is high power draw. This thing goes through batteries quickly. Get the Vivitar or Wasabi kit with external charger and two extra batteries. I figure around 250 shots per battery and I'm not even using power zoom.<br /><br />And yeah, the unfortunate decision not to include a dedicated charger is just stupid. Come on SONY. In camera charging is not acceptable.<br /><br />In case you haven't figured this out yet: I really like this camera and the two SONY lenses!ns!

Amina Shaik,5,"light, super portable and great image quality!",2015-02-09,Y,"Light and super portable! Image quality is greater than expected thanks to the 24 million pixels Sony puts on the APS-C size sensor, so that you can get great image quality even at high ISO (&#62;3200).<br />As for the fast auto focusing I haven't experienced it yet because I only used my two manual focus lenses on it. Up to now I am not bothered by any red shift problem for the A6000 using the two rangefinder lenses (Voigtlander Nokton 35/1.4 and Zeiss ZM 25/2.8).<br />On the whole, I am pretty happy with this little guy on some street photography and casual occasions.

Some may say I downgraded it, but honestly, I believe I made the right choice.<br />Sony A6000 meets and exceeds the expectation I had in digital camera. It is especially useful when you take outdoor activities where there are a lot of movements. I would have missed quite a lot of good moments if I kept/used my RX1, which is more of a street photography or a still portrait.<br />I used SONY 18-105 G lens. It’s not a superb lens, but I have no complaints about it.<br />Coming from SONY RX1 and Fuji cameras with silent shutters, a6000’s shutter sound is loud. I kind a like it. When I couple my a6000 with a zoom lens, it’s obvious to the people that I am taking photos. I don’t have to be discreet to them, so I might as well sound professional to the people by making loud continuous shutter sounds. However, I will not purchase those premium-brand prime lenses and couple them with A6000.

Smriti,5,Very highly recommended,2015-02-02,Y,"It seems like I waited forever to make the switch from DSLR to mirrorless and I'm glad that I waited this long. There were options available (in the Fuji world) a long time ago that offered on-par image quality to a DSLR but the price-to-performance ration wasn't present. Until Sony a6000 showed up... this camera was a bargain at $800 and when Sony dropped the price to $600, I simply ran out to reasons to not buy this camera. This offers manual and semi-manual shooting modes, RAW capture, built-in WiFi, apps, flip-out screen, compact size, array of lenses, 24p video and everything else you expect from a prosumer DSLR. In addition to these, there are custom Sony goodies like eye-focus, face-recognition and smile-shutter. I'm still learning all the tricks this camera offers and it might take me another few weeks before I master this tool but I can already say that I'm extremely happy with this purchase.

Swarnalata panda,1,"Worst Instruction Manual of any Camera I have ever bought, and slow Autofocus",2015-02-01,Y,"(1) The Sony A6000 has the WORST INSTRUCTION MANUAL of any camera I have ever bought.  Other than telling the buyer rudimentary things such as how to insert the battery, put in a memory card, and set date and time (which are the same for all digital cameras), the A6000 Instruction Manual is 100 PERCENT USELESS.  The 44-page Instruction Manual merely lists the numerous features of the camera, but GIVES NO INFORMATION ON HOW TO ACCESS THOSE FEATURES, and gives zero information on  how to use them.<br /><br />I wasted 30 infuriating minutes trying to find 'Focus Peaking' and 'Focus Magnification' in the Menus of the A6000 - but they are nowhere in the Menus (where they can be found on my Sony A65), and ZERO INFORMATION on how to find, or use, these features is given in the Instruction Manual.<br /><br />When I got the ultra-complex Sony A6000 with its useless 'Instruction Manual' which provides no information, I was ready to return it after 2 days.<br /><br />Without far better information than is given in Sony's cheap, shoddy, inadequate 44-page Instruction Manual, the features of the Sony A6000 are unusable.<br /><br />(2) SLOW AUTOFOCUS. Using the Factory Settings (Default Settings), the Autofocus on my A6000 was ultra-slow, the camera 'hunts' back and forth for a full second - and often ends up completely out of focus!  My much cheaper Panasonic [[ASIN:B00814CAS2 Panasonic LUMIX DMC-ZS19 Digital Camera- Black]] point-and-shoot camera unerringly and accurately autofocusses in a fraction of a second. With the Sony 55 - 210 mm telephoto zoom lens, Sony's autofocus system in the A6000 will often take a nearly-correct focus setting and change it to totally-out-of-focus, and then 'hunt' for focus. Sony's autofocus firmware for the A6000 desperately needs replacement (see UPDATE below). The Sony A6000 autofocus is slower than the earliest Autofocus cameras of the 1980s and 1990s.<br /><br />(3)  NO BATTERY CHARGER. The A6000 comes with no battery charger, but instead witha cable to allow the battery to be charged (slowly) from a computer's USB port. The battery must be in the camera, the recharge time is 310 minutes. This is Sony being cheap, and it's ridiculous. If the battery runs down, you cannot take photos for 5 hours 10 minutes because the camera must be used to recharge the battery.<br /><br />For a better alternative, you will need to invest  $26.99  in the  [[ASIN:B0049WBZEK Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha 7, a7, Alpha 7R, a7R, Alpha 7S, a7S, Alpha a3000, Alpha a5000, Alpha a6000, NEX-3, NEX-3N, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-5R, NEX-5T, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, NEX-F3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, ]] to get what Sony prefers not  to provide.<br /><br />On the positive side, my Sony A6000 (Silver, not black) is nicely made.  I had been looking at the Sony NEX 7 whose 'Build Quality' was praised as 'superb' by DPReview, but the fit and finish of my Silver A6000 is very nice, it exceeds my expectations. The workers in Thailand who make the camera have done a good job, and it is not their fault that incompetent Sony management decided to include a 44-page throwaway Manual which insults the buyer. A possible remedy is:<br /><br />(4) REMEDY - A MANUAL WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION: Investing $41 in [[ASIN:1312318791 The Complete Guide to Sony's A6000 Camera (B&W edition)]]  provides the basic information which Sony is too lazy to provide. Unlike Sony's Manual, this book actually tells you how to find and use the camera's features, and this may make the Sony A6000 usable.<br /><br />The mis-named 'Instruction Manual' for the A6000 is really just a 'Quick Start Guide,' telling you how to put a battery in the camera, put a memory card in the camera, and set time and date. This is followed by a listing of other functions, but no information is given on how to find or use the other functions.<br /><br />The 'Instruction Manual' fails to give 95 percent of the Instructions the user needs to operate the camera.It's really just a 'Quick Start Guide.'<br /><br />UPDATE, April 2016:<br />.<br />(1) AUTOFOCUS  NOW WORKS, AFTER UPDATING FIRMWARE AND ERASING DEFAULT SETTINGS.  My review above, written in February 2015,  referred to an early version with its factory-default settings, and with Firmware Version 1.0.  Its autofocus behavior was bizarre: the camera could be close to correct focus, but depressing the shutter release made it move way off focus. The camera was literally unusable.  Consulting the [[ASIN:1312318791 The Complete Guide to Sony's A6000 Camera (B&W edition)]], I discovered that the camera has five (5) Focus Modes, a fact which Sony's totally useless Instruction Manual doesn't tell you.  The default setting was AF-A (Automatic);  which makes the camera switch, out of control by the user, between AF-S (Single-shot) and AF-C (Continuous). I cancelled the default AF-A, and set it to AF-S.<br /><br />  I also noticed that the camera kept focusing on whatever it was pointing at, even if I did not touch the shutter release. thus draining the battery. This feature is called Pre-Autofocus, and it's enabled by default. It's not mentioned in either the Instruction Manual or the Help Guide, and finding out how to disable it took me several hours (the disable switch is buried in a third-level submenu). I disabled Pre-AF.<br />  With these two default settings disabled, the AF became tolerable, but still  slow..<br /><br />  Checking further: Sony had issued two successive Firmware Updates since Version 1.0. With the online assistance of a very helpful Sony technical support representative I installed Firmware Version 2.0. The new Version 2.0  gave a marked improvement in AF performance. With both the 18-55mm  lens which I prefer (the earlier 18-55mm lens has the superior manual zoom, and much less distortion than the newer 16-50mm), and the excellent  55-210mm telephoto, the camera now focusses quickly and accurately..<br /><br />  In summary, getting rid of the defaultFocus Mode settings and updating firmware to Version 2.0 greatly improved the AF.<br /><br />(2)  INSTRUCTION MANUAL.  The Instruction Manual supplied with the a6000 is useless, you need the 'Help Guide.'. Go online to 'Sony - eSupport,'  choose 'Alpha Cameras,' 'Manuals, Specs and Warranty;'enter the 'Model Number'  which is:  ILCE 6000, then ignore 'Instruction Manual' and instead download the 'Help Guide (Printable PDF).'<br />  It's not an expository guide, and makes no attempt to explain things to the uninitiated..But it does list most (but not all) of the camera functions, none of which are mentioned in the Instruction Manual.<br /><br />This is is now a pleasant and usable camera.  Battery life is not long. You will need extra batteries and a charger, especially if you travel. The Wasabi Power set:  [[ASIN:B0049WBZEK Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger for Sony NP-FW50 and Sony Alpha 7, a7, Alpha 7R, a7R, Alpha 7S, a7S, Alpha a3000, Alpha a5000, Alpha a6000, NEX-3, NEX-3N, NEX-5, NEX-5N, NEX-5R, NEX-5T, NEX-6, NEX-7, NEX-C3, NEX-F3, SLT-A33, SLT-A35, SLT-A37, ]]  is a no-brainer",46,26,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,4

I picked up this camera just under a week ago, I borrowed my buddy's \\""kit\\"" lens that he never uses and took this sony a6000 body  for a spin.  Since my Nikon D750 is currently being serviced for a \\""internal flare issue\\"", I figured to give the a6000 a go.....amazon is great about returning unhappy products.  Anyways, I like you, have read all the reviews and hype about this camera, the pros and cons about mirrorless vs. traditional DSLR's.  I wanted a second camera, not as big and bulky as my Nikon setup, but a portable unit with video and wifi for the family and travel.    My experience with this camera has been fantastic!  Will I sell my Nikon D750,....I don't know.  What I do know is that image quality and video are fantastic, but more importantly, face detection is AMAZING!  Why can't pro DSLR's have this?  Video is sharp, focus is quiet and fast and accurate.  I can't get this type of video performance out of my D750, or any traditional DSLR for that matter.  THIS SONY A6000 has everything my D750 has plus more.......IT SHOULD BE THE OTHER AROUND.  I can shoot video with one hand and the result seems like I had this camera on a tripod, image stabilization is fantastic on this unit, both video and picture.  and lets not for get the 11fps shooting and the auto focus......WOW!    1 thing a forgot to mention is the EVF......it's really an eye opener...! Both the LCD and EVF are great in a sense that u get the exact picture u see.....lots of information, makes manual shooting a breeze.      Im sure you have or will read technical info on this A6000 on other reviews, but I just got back from my sisters place, and the pictures and video of my newborn nephew are simply amazing!  I know I used a 16-50mm \\""kit\\"" lens, but it performed great for video, and the pictures were really good, sharp in the center, and detailed.  The sensor is awesome, mind you, Nikon uses sony sensors.....I didn't know that!    BUY IT, its an awesome camera....if you don't let it, return it to amazon!  Mines a keeper, and when I get a proper lens, if it still is \\""wowing\\"" me, I might just sell my Nikon D750 setup......maybe.

FAZIL NAWAZ,4,"Exceptional camera -- feature laden, complicated, compact and moderately priced",2015-01-26,Y,"This is an exceptional camera in many ways. I state this not as a professional photographer, but as an advanced hobbyist with other very good (Canon) photography equipment. The fast focus makes it possible to very quickly take many shots, and the auto HDR is a feature I enjoy very much. It is small in size, though not as small as other mirrorless cameras I've used, still much lighter than the typical DSLR units. The lenses look large on the body. In my uninformed mind, I equate that with better lenses than you find, for example, on the little point and shoot cameras and the phone cameras -- and my results, though I'm still getting accustomed to the equipment, have been very pleasing. Certainly I would stipulate that anything wrong with the photos I've taken come from the photographer and not the camera. I'd recommend this to anyone. I am now looking for a reasonably priced adapter that will permit me to make use of some of the expensive Canon lenses I own. If I am successful, that will get me to five stars with this very impressive but complicated little machine. I should note I originally purchased the Alpha 5000 and returned it because it does not have an eyepiece viewfinder like this a6000.

Amazon Customer,5,Terrific little camera,2015-01-25,Y,"EDIT 2/13/2015: I have added a few small updates below, in between brackets and preceded by **.<br /><br />EDIT 7/26/2015: I have added one more update below, again in between brackets, but preceded by ***.<br /><br />I picked up my a6000 during the Black Friday deal frenzy and got myself a sweet deal for the cam and the Rokinon 12mm f/2.0.  After having it put through its paces for a few months now, I'm thoroughly enamored by this little camera.<br /><br />Just a little background on yours truly: I've been shooting with a Nikon D5000 for five years.  It was my first serious camera, and even though I feel like I've milked that thing light-years beyond its natural lifespan, it's still going strong.  Over the last five years I've become quite the skilled landscape photography enthusiast, mostly through lots of trial and error and hours of YouTube tutorials.  With my advancement in the craft came a few annoyances with my camera, though: the 12 MPs, noisy images at higher ISOs, and lack of direct controls, to name the most important.  It was time for an upgrade.<br /><br />What drew me to the Sony a6000 was frankly not just its rich feature set, but sheer value.  At $448 (the price I paid), I got a fast camera with the latest 24 MP APS-C sensor, IQ and video features similar to the Nikons, and also way more direct controls than on the Nikon D5X00 line.  In short, I felt like I got a D7100 for a D3300 price.  The weight reduction and compactness weren't really a factor to me, but a nice bonus nonetheless.<br /><br />Let me break the rest of my review down into some pros and cons, based on two months of intermittent use.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* I love, love, love the EVF.  It took me all but 20 minutes to get used to it.  I'm using solely manual lenses for now, which is fine, because I shoot mainly landscapes.  MF assist is a breeze, and I like the 'what-you-see-is-what-you-get' image in the viewfinder.  My legacy glass, barely usable on my Nikon, is now a joy to use through $15 Fotasy adapters.  (I'd definitely like to take that snappy AF and 11 FPS for a spin some day, though. :-) )<br />* I find the menus very intuitive and love that I have all the important controls just a click away.  No longer do I need to navigate the menus to change the ISO!<br />* The increase in resolution from 12 to 24 MP is sweet.  I know many pundits pooh-pooh this notion, but there's definitely a lot more pop to my images, even when viewed in normal size.  The ability to crop and/or blow up my images is welcome as well, of course.<br />* Dynamic range is good, though probably not a whole lot better than the D5000.  (I haven't done a side-by-side comparison.)  [** DR is actually better - up to a point. Noise levels after lifting shadows are lower than on my old Nikon files.  See also update below.]<br />* High ISO is terrific.  I love to do astroscapes, which is where the D5000 fell short: ISO 1600, ok... ISO 2500, meh... ISO 3200, almost unusable.  With the a6000 I have no hesitation bumping up the ISO to 3200, and even 6400 is acceptable for astro work.  This cam and the Rokinon lens are going to be a killer combo for that purpose.<br />* I'm a serious time lapse shooter, and battery life, or potential lack thereof, had me a little concerned for sure.  I guess, though, that the advertised battery life of 340 shots assumes a fair share of fiddling in the menus and reviewing images at 100%.  I did four time lapse sequences of 300 frames each one day and had 65% of my battery left, more than enough to shoot some video of my kids the day after.  This cam holds its own for time lapse use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Occasionally the infamous Sony RAW compression comes to the surface in post-processing.  One can beat up the images pretty severely without any negative consequences, but do some random dodging at 0.5 EV or higher, and ugly black spots start to show up.  Here I did do a comparison with the Nikon files, and the Sony files bit the dust.  They definitely do not play nice with the Lightroom brush.  You'll be fine pulling highlights, boosting shadows and pushing exposure, though, in addition to 'normal' use of the brush.  I know this test was fairly extreme, but some readers may want to take it into account. [** The a6000's files definitely have an occasional issue with highlight recovery.  Under some circumstances, highlights will look blown out on your PC screen, even though the histogram says they're not.  It's hard to recover them.  I can't really quantify this, but I think the Nikon files are easier to correct in this regard.]<br />* The SD card slot is kind of crammed next to the battery, making it rather hard to get the card out.  To make matters worse, I purchased an Arca-Swiss-compatible L bracket.  I'm now contemplating getting a pair of tweezers just for pulling the SD card out of its slot.  It's that hard.<br />* The camera's buttons become totally unresponsive when a wired remote is hooked up to it.  This may seem like a minor quirk, but every time I want to change, say, WB or exposure, I have to unplug my remote!  Very unhandy.  So all ye time lapsers out there who shoot 'Holy Grail' sequences using external triggers and the LRTimelapse method of adjusting exposure during the sequence, you can forget about the a6000.  (Perhaps there's a menu setting I'm missing; If that's the case, please let me know in the comments!)  [*** Very annoying: it turned out to be the particular third-party remote I was using!  It broke and I replaced it with a different model, which doesn't exhibit this behavior.]<br />* [** Dust spots all over the place!  You might as well order a cleaning kit along with your a6000, because spots will start to show up on your images after just a few months.  As a reference: I've had my D5000 cleaned twice in 5 years.  Cleaning kits are inexpensive and tutorials on how to clean your sensor can be found all over YouTube, though.]<br />* Finally a con that's not really a reflection on this product itself, but still a consideration: As many others, I'm concerned about the future of the E mount.  Sony have given us a few zooms and some nice primes, but especially good long lenses are missing in their lineup, and development of new lenses has come to a standstill.  Now that the FE cameras have become such a hit, it's sure looking like Sony is going to expect us APS-C users to shell out $1,000+ for full-frame primes to use on our small cameras.  I have no desire to go this route, however.<br /><br />Frankly, the last bullet is the only one keeping me from wholeheartedly recommending this camera to each and everyone of you.  It's really a shame that Sony are leaving enthusiasts on a budget like myself out in the cold a bit.  Even if I wanted to invest some money in a few good prime lenses, I can't be sure that Sony are committed to building out their APS-C lens lineup, which makes me rather hesitant to spend any money at all.  Not all of us can afford to shell out north of a grand on a single lens, let alone 4 or 5 on a system.<br /><br />With that said, I will still give the camera five stars and recommend it to others, keeping the above caveat in mind.  I'm really happy with my purchase and the boost it brought to my images.  The a6000 is an engineering marvel and a great joy to use.  I've fallen in love with the mirrorless concept, and regardless of whether I stay with Sony, I don't see myself going back to DSLRs any time soon.  If you're an advanced enthusiast who can live with the current lens lineup and/or doesn't mind using adapters, I don't think you can really go wrong with this one, even at MSRP.

So, let me break down the differences between the two:<br /><br />a6000: lcd tilts a bit, but can't face the other side of the camera for self-videos<br />a5100: lcd flips over the top for self-videos<br /><br />a6000: max 24Mbps video (AVCHD)<br />a5100: max 50Mbps video (XAVC-S)<br /><br />a6000: fast initial burst rate (11 frames per second), slows to 2 frames after 5-10 seconds.<br />a5100: slower initial burst rate (6 frames per second), slows to 4 frames after 30-60 seconds<br /><br />a6000: has electronic viewfinder (EVF) and hot-shoe for microphones, flashes, etc.<br />a5100: lacks EVF and hot-shoe<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that any APC sensor like the a6000 and a5100 have will not be able to achieve shallow depth-of-field of full-frame sensor cameras like the A7ii.",4,3,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,4
C. Ravi Kumar,5,Excellent piece of equipment:  Out went the Canon pro gear!,2015-01-21,Y,"I have just recently received this camera after reading tons of reviews, manuals, videos, etc. In short..this camera is totally amazing.  I come from using Canons for many years, but after two months contemplating the purchase of the Sony, I decided to go ahead and get it... My thinking was I can always sell it if I don't like it.  Now, even after a week's use, you will have to pry this camera out of my cold, dead hands.  It is that good.  My Canon gear will be handed down to my daughter, and I will start to use this camera in all situations.  I have the 18-55, the 55-210, and the Sigma 60mm prime for this camera, all in silver.  Later, I might buy a Yongnuo adapter so I can sneak a Canon lens out of the bag once and a while if I need to.  However, with the 3 lens I have, it all fits into a pretty small bag and the ranges are covered for my every need.  Would I use this camera Professionally?  Absolutely.  It puts my Canon gear to shame in almost every way. I am sure, when the Client sees this diminutive camera, they will think it is a toy.  However, the results will speak for themselves.  The menu system is long and quite involved.  At first, it appeared to me almost incomprehensible, because just about every button can be assigned different functions, plus there are 3 Memories and 2 customizable buttons.  Once you have it set up they way YOU want to shoot, it is all there waiting for you to push the button.  The camera straight out of the box is amazing in itself, but after you twiddle a few dials for your own style of shooting, the camera goes from amazing to awesome.  I do not have one negative thing to say about this camera.  No doubt Sony will come up with an improved model at some date, but what they have produced here is a true winner.  I now understand why many of the recognizable Pro's are going to the mirror-less systems, and Sony in particular.  The price is fantastic for the value received in this little package.  I highly recommend it.",7,7,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2

Amazon Customer,4,Excellent But Not Perfect,2015-01-18,Y,"I got this camera as a Christmas present. I have a Canon 60D and Nikon P7700 and wanted a camera, with at lest an APS-C sensor, that is easy to take everywhere. The A6000 meets all of those criteria and is fun to use. The menu takes a little getting use to and I still haven't figured all of it out yet, but I am having fun learning. The only issues I have with the A6000 is, in my opinion, it should have 2 separate control wheels for aperture and shutter speed. The other is Sony needs to work on their lenses. The kit lens has vignetting when shot at 16 mm as does the 55-210 mm at 55 mm. Both are easily corrected in Lightroom, but you shouldn't have to. I recently purchased an adapter so I could use my old Canon lenses and all i can say is WOW! The images are amazing, sharp, excellent color and no vignetting. If you are looking for a great APS-C camera you can take everywhere easily, look no further.",0,0,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,1
Amazon Customer,5,"Highly recommend!  Great portability, reliable focus, excellent focus speed!",2015-01-18,Y,"First a little background.  I've been using DSLR cameras since 2005, and have owned 4 dslrs and multiple point and shoots.  Then I got a Sony NEX 5n  for the portability factor 3 years ago and loved it, but it didn't have a viewfinder or built in flash.  I spent a lot of money for an add on viewfinder and flash, but on the NEX 5n you could only use the flash OR the viewfinder, but couldn't use both at the same time, because they both hooked into the same accessory port.<br /><br />I purchased the A6000 recently, and it is an ENORMOUS upgrade from NEX 5n.  It has everything I loved about the NEX 5n (a tad bit larger, though) and countless improvements. Its focus is great and it's great for low light shots. My most used lenses are the Sigma 19mm EX DN and the Sigma 30mm EX DN, as well as the Sony 50mm f1.8.  I also have the Sony kit lens from my NEX 5n, which is an 18-55mm, and a Tamron 18-200.  Both of those lenses are &#34;okay&#34;, but not as sharp as the aforementioned.<br /><br />I somewhat miss having the touch screen that the NEX 5n has, but its well worth the trade-off to have the viewfinder and built in flash.  The tiny flash on the A6000 actually does work pretty well for close up shots (5-6 feet away) and I love that it can be held back and made to bounce the light.  I purchased some &#34;bounce cards&#34; inexpensively here on Amazon, that can be slid into the hot shoe mount and they hold the built in flash back for me in the bounce position, so I don't have to hold it back with my finger.  They work great.  I think I will still want to purchase an external flash later on, but the built in flash works well enough that I can hold off on that for awhile.<br /><br />To speed my learning curve, I purchased an interactive video tutorial (How To Unleash The Power Of Your A6000) from Gary Fong dot com for $12.95.  This was a good investment for me in learning the ins and outs of the A6000.<br /><br />This camera will not replace my Canon 70d w/ huge 150-600mm zoom lens, because I still need that for my grandkids' football games, and for shooting birds and wildlife.  For indoor photography or for street photography or museums, the Sony A6000 is just perfect for me.  I would highly recommend it, especially for someone who takes a lot of indoor shots.",9,8,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2

tulika saluja,1,In My Opinion; Overly Complex And Very Pooly Documented - Updated,2015-01-09,N,"Purchased this exact camera from a local 'big box' retailer about a week ago.    Seems to have potential... but in my opinion is very much overly complex, abysmally documented, and lean on 'intuitiveness'. Three stars off right there. (Almost subtracted 4 and still might; time will tell.)    Any item this complex would require quite a hefty manual detailing it's seemingly endless list of functions/features/acronyms... not the supplied little pamphlet, terse minimal 'screen hints' (or whatever they're called) and website.    I found this camera to be very much more complex/confusing than even a fully manual camera, and very easy to become lost/bewildered/mired within it's eternal menus, settings, acronyms and perplexing arrays of tiny icons.    Would I buy again or suggest this camera to a friend?    No.    Review posted 1/08/2015 and will be updated should future experience warrant.    *** Update *** 2/01/2015. Again, this camera seems to have potential, but sadly, time has come to decrease my product rating to one star.    Without adequate documentation, configuring/reconfiguring this product to accommodate varying and different shooting situations/conditions has, in my opinion, proven a time consuming odious awkward chore... and not worth the expenditure of further time effort and aggravation.    Mirror-less will soon overtake the camera market I'm sure... but far as this iteration is concerned, I feel DSLR's remain the superior technology.

Amazon Customer,5,An overall great camera.,2015-01-05,N,"After a lot of consideration, I switched from my Canon to the Sony A6000 last April. After using it for more than 9 months now, I definitely think I made the right decision. I'm super loyal to Canon, and still use my old one. My main reason for buying this camera is because I wanted something with a smaller, more portable body while still having as close to DSLR quality as possible. Carrying around a clunky DSLR while I was traveling so often was getting old.<br /><br />The autofocus and shutter speed on this camera is no joke - it's fast! I couldn't believe how fast it took the picture in the beginning, but I love that it saves me time because I don't have to struggle with the camera trying to focus even in low light situations. Since I use this camera mostly for travel photography, I don't play too much with the functions and rely on the camera to take the best possible pictures.<br /><br />I'm not a professional photographer by any means - I usually use it on the scene functions and rely on them to work well. And work well they do! I've played with most of the settings and they are easy to use and produce stunning pictures. The only setting that sometimes gives me problems is the panorama setting - it is really finicky and many times struggles to take it if there is too much movement in the picture. I don't use it that often, but when I do it is a little frustrating. For example, I was taking a picture of the ocean but the waves were moving too quickly and it was almost impossible to get the panorama shot no matter how many times I tried!<br /><br />I really enjoy the send to smartphone option and ended up using it more than I thought I would. It makes sending pictures to my phone really simple, and I can share them easily and quickly when I'm traveling without my computer and still want to share my photos.<br /><br />The camera has a digital viewfinder that pops out for easy viewing and it auto detects when your eye comes close to the camera and switches it off so that you can look manually. It's a nice feature but can be annoying sometimes when my strap gets close to it and it turns off the digital viewfinder.<br /><br />Overall, this camera takes great pictures with little effort! You sacrifice a little quality for the smaller size, but it is well worth it!so that you can look manually.

Amazon Customer,4,Good but not enough for me,2015-01-05,Y,"I tried out this camera as a substitute for my Nikon D600.  I love my D600 but when I travel and have to lug around what seems like 20 pounds worth of camera gear, I want to shoot myself.  I travel with at least one camera body and a multitude of lenses including a very heavy 70-200mm telephoto.  On any given day, I also have my DSLR and at least one extra lens with me so it would be great if I could find a small point-and-shoot sized camera that's close to pro quality.  This camera comes very close but I'm afraid not close enough for me.  There are still things that I like to do with my full size (long exposures in particular) that I don't think this camera will do.  I'm still not confident enough in this camera to leave my D600 at home.

Karan Kumar,5,Review from A Street Photographer,2015-01-04,Y,"As street photographer I have been using a Canon 5D Mark 3.  This is an outstanding camera but it does attract a lot of attention, especially with a white lens.  I wanted an alternative so I purchased a Sony Alpha a6000.  I had some problems with the focus of the first copy so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement.  The second copy is a true gem.  The kit lens is not as sharp as my Canon lenses, but for me it is a worthwhile trade off.  I have spent hours wandering the streets, getting absurdly close to people who pay no attention to me because I use the fold out screen to frame my photos rather than the viewfinder.  So I am getting shots that would not have been possible before.  I find that when I ask a stranger if I can take their photo, they are more inclined to say yes because this little camera is not intimidating.  This was one of the best investments I have made in a long time and I'm delighted by this camera's size and capability.",8,7,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2
Amazon Customer,5,Good Backup Camera for Pros,2015-01-03,Y,"I bought two of these for Christmas.  One for me and one for my wife.  We are both photographers and we primarily shoot Nikon DSLR cameras but like Sony mirrorless cameras because they are light weight and are good backup cameras. Prior to this purchase we were using Sony NEX 5 cameras as our backup cameras but we weren't happy with the limited bracketing capabilities, i.e. 1/3 Fstop with only 3 shots in the bracket set.  That essentially made the cameras worthless for HDR shooting when high dynamic scenes were involved.  Another photographer friend bought one of these and sang its praises to me before Christmas.  I did a lot of research and the 11 frames per second, 25k ISO, view finder and the super auto focus got my attention. We already had Sony E-Mount lenses so I bought two A6000 bodies.<br /><br />So far we are loving these cameras and have already taken several pictures with different light levels. The processed images are beautiful and the onboard stabilization seem to work quite well.  They camera seems to be noise free up to about 3200 ISO.  More testing will be necessary but so far this inexpensive camera is very impressive.  A negative is that they didn't provide a 110/12volt charger.  Because of the low price and many nice features, it appears that Sony cut corners by eliminating the chargers.  We already had ours from our NEX 5 cameras so it isn't a big deal.  That brings up another nice benefit.  This camera uses the same batteries as the NEX 5 cameras. As for charging, they do provide a USB charging cable that requires charging to be done with the battery in the camera. This is a slow process but it works.  If you by this camera, I suggest you buy a separate charger and a few extra batteries.  They are inexpensive and will allow you to quickly charge your batteries.  I hope this information is helpful.  So far we really like these cameras and we are experienced photographers.",39,36,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3

Amazon Customer,5,Top Notch Mirrorless Camera for the pro and novice alike!!!,2015-01-03,Y,"I absolutely love it!!! This camera is everything I wanted in a mirrorless camera. The interface is a little funky, but the quality of the pictures in a small compact camera is EXCELLENT!!! I am an active shooter of photography and this camera does everything I need it to do.<br /><br />It produces 24 megapixel raw images very fast, and very well. I have been impressed with the depth and quality of the color it produces. Depending on the lens you are shooting with, the speed of the focus will either be super fast, or in the case of the kit lens, it will be a bit sluggish.<br /><br />If you are looking for a mirrorless camera that can shoot high quality images, excellent shooting modes like the excellent built in pano mode, aperture priority, shutter priority, super high iso capabilities and an easy to use manual mode when you want it.<br /><br />If you are a camera novice and want an excellent alternative to the cheapo point and shoot cameras you will not be disappointed. Highly recommend.<br /><br />I have included a couple of pictures I shot with this camera and did very little processing to them!!! Hope you like them",50,45,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,2

Amazon Customer,5,Some of the other cameras in this league would be more than that for just body and crappy kit lens,2015-01-01,Y,"This may not technically be the &#34;best&#34; mirrorless camera, but for the 450 i paid for the body, and the extra 600 i spent for the 35mm sony and 19mm sigma i am blown away. Some of the other cameras in this league would be more than that for just body and crappy kit lens. I know the e mount selection is limited, but unless you are a pro and need a lens for every possible scenario, i'd say who cares. Great camera, very glad i purchased it.",2,2,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,3
Amazon Customer,5,the  lumix gx7 is a dream to work love that camera,2015-01-01,Y,"no instructions,no charger,had to buy one,sony is only interested to the bottom line....however the camera is great the kit lens is wonderful,and the coler could not be better.Sony should listen to TO the customers that make them what they are,asnd forget  about the A6000 2.

Amazon Customer,3,"Without decent lenses, what good is this great sensor?",2015-01-01,N,"I don't think anyone who is used to a digital SLR is going to be satisfied with the photos.  The lenses for this camera (I tried the sony 35mm, 50mm, kit zoom, and 50-210 zoom) just aren't very good optically.  Perhaps if you pay 800 for the Zeiss lenses it is a good alternative to an SLR, but I just don't see how this is a good platform to invest in.  It's a great sensor so if you want so so images that are pretty clean through ISO 1600, this is a way better system than a point and shoot, but I think at 500 to 700 and close to 1000 with a decent prime lens, this camera gets very expensive for the mediocre images it produces.  The Fuji photos and micro 4/3 photos all look better to me than what I see with the sony mirrorless cameras.",12,6,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,1

khushal,5,This is the first DSLR I have truly loved. I've used Nikon,2014-12-31,Y,"This is the first DSLR I have truly loved. I've used Nikon, Canon, and the NEX 3n. The focus speed really is much faster with the a6000. The clarity is phenomenal and the camera is generally snappy.<br /><br />To get the best pictures out of this camera be prepared to read the manual, reconfigure the camera, and do a lot of testing. The first thing you should do is remap the auto-focus to the AEL button on the back. Next, you need to change the focus area that the auto focus uses and practice with it. Getting really sharp images takes a lot of practice with this camera. It's not that the camera is flawed, it is that the camera is so fast, I'm pushing my experience using it.<br /><br />I've used my a6000 with Rokinon and Sigma lens with zero problems.",1,1,Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera with 16-50mm Power Zoom Lens,4
